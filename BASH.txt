[NAME]
       bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell

[DEFINITIONS]
       The following definitions are used throughout the rest of this document.
       blank             ---> A space or tab.
       word / token      ---> A sequence of characters considered as a single unit by the shell.
       name / identifier ---> A word  consisting  only of alphanumeric characters and underscores, and beginning with an alphabetic character or an underscore.
       metacharacter     ---> A character that, when unquoted, separates words. One of the following:

                                                        |  & ; ( ) < > space tab newline

       control operator  ---> A token that performs a control function. It is one of the following symbols:

                                                        || & && ; ;; ;& ;;& ( ) | |& <newline>

[RESERVED WORDS]
       Reserved words are words that have a special meaning to the shell.
                        
                              ! case  coproc  do done elif else esac fi for function if in select then until while { } time [[ ]]

[SHELL GRAMMAR]
   Simple Commands: -
   ---------------
       1. A simple command is a blank-separated words with sequence of optional variable, redirections, terminated by a control operator.
       2. The remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command.
       3. The return value of a simple command is its exit status, or 128+n if the command is terminated by signal n. Where n refers to signal number.

   Pipelines: -
   ---------
       A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of the control operators | or |&. The format for a pipeline is:

              [ time [ -p ] ] [ ! ] command1 [ [ |⎪ |& ] command2 ... ]

       1.The standard output and error of "command1" is connected via a pipe to the standard input of "command2".
       2. If |& is used then "command1" (standard error and output) and "command2" (standard input); it is shorthand for 2>&1 |.
       3. If pipefail option is enabled, the return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command with a non-zero status or zero if all commands exit successfully.
       4. If the "!" at prefix of a pipeline, then shell return value of logical negation after termination of all commands.
       5. If the "time" at prefix of a pipeline, then shell return time (user, system, elapsed) after termination of all commands.
       6. The "-p" option changes output format that specified by POSIX.

   Lists: -
   -----
       A list is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the operators ;  &  &&  or  ||  and optionally terminated by one of  ;  &  <newline>.

       1. && and ||  followed by ; and & both have equal precedence.
       2. Command terminated by control operator &, the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell and does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0. These are referred to as asynchronous commands.
       3. Commands separated by ; are executed sequentially, the shell waits for each command to terminate in sequence. The return status is the exit status of the last command executed. These are referred to as synchronous commands.
       4. AND list form, if command1 returns an exit status 0 (successfully executed) then command2 is executed. Example: command1 && command2
       5. OR list form, if command2 returns an exit status non-zero (not successfully executed) then command2 is executed. Example: command1 || command2

   Compound Commands: -
   -----------------
       A compound command is one of the following. In most cases a list in a command's description may be separated from the rest of the command by one or more newlines, and may be followed by a newline in place of a semicolon.

       (list)				--> list expression with subshell environment
       { list; }            --> list expression with no subshell environment
       ((expression))		--> arithematic expression
       [[ expression ]]		--> conditional expression

       1. When the == and != operators are used, the string (right side) of the operator is considered a pattern and matched according to the rules described below under Pattern Matching.
       2. If the extglob shell option were enabled. The = operator is equivalent to ==.
       3. If the nocasematch shell option is enabled, the match is performed without case sensetive. The return value is 0 if the string matches (==) or does not match (!=) the pattern, and 1 otherwise.
       4. Quoted portion in pattern will considered as string.

       5. An additional binary operator =~ is available, with the same precedence as == and !=.  When it is used, the string to the right of the operator is considered a POSIX extended regular expression and matched accordingly. The return value is 0 (pattern matches), 1 (pattern not matches), 2 (pattern matches without case sensetive).
       6. Bracket expressions in regular expressions must be treated carefully, since normal quoting characters lose their meanings between brackets. If the pattern is stored in a shell variable, quoting the variable expansion forces the entire pattern to be matched as a string.

       The  pattern  will match if it matches any part of the string.  Anchor the pattern using the ^ and $ regular expression operators to force it to match the entire
       string.  The array variable BASH_REMATCH records which parts of the string matched the pattern.  The element of BASH_REMATCH with index 0 contains the portion of
       the  string  matching the entire regular expression.  Substrings matched by parenthesized subexpressions within the regular expression are saved in the remaining
       BASH_REMATCH indices. The element of BASH_REMATCH with index n is the portion of the string matching the nth parenthesized subexpression.

       Expressions may be combined using the following operators, listed in decreasing order of precedence:

              ( expression )
                     Returns the value of expression.  This may be used to override the normal precedence of operators.
              ! expression
                     True if expression is false.
              expression1 && expression2
                     True if both expression1 and expression2 are true.
              expression1 || expression2
                     True if either expression1 or expression2 is true.

              The && and || operators do not evaluate expression2 if the value of expression1 is sufficient to determine the return value of the entire conditional  ex‐
              pression.

       for name [ [ in [ word ... ] ] ; ] do list ; done
              The  list  of words following in is expanded, generating a list of items.  The variable name is set to each element of this list in turn, and list is exe‐
              cuted each time.  If the in word is omitted, the for command executes list once for each positional parameter that is set (see PARAMETERS below).  The re‐
              turn  status  is  the exit status of the last command that executes.  If the expansion of the items following in results in an empty list, no commands are
              executed, and the return status is 0.

       for (( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3 )) ; do list ; done
              First, the arithmetic expression expr1 is evaluated according to the rules described below under ARITHMETIC EVALUATION.  The arithmetic  expression  expr2
              is  then  evaluated  repeatedly until it evaluates to zero.  Each time expr2 evaluates to a non-zero value, list is executed and the arithmetic expression
              expr3 is evaluated.  If any expression is omitted, it behaves as if it evaluates to 1.  The return value is the exit status of the last  command  in  list
              that is executed, or false if any of the expressions is invalid.

       select name [ in word ] ; do list ; done
              The  list  of  words following in is expanded, generating a list of items.  The set of expanded words is printed on the standard error, each preceded by a
              number.  If the in word is omitted, the positional parameters are printed (see PARAMETERS below).  The PS3 prompt is then displayed and a line  read  from
              the  standard  input.   If  the line consists of a number corresponding to one of the displayed words, then the value of name is set to that word.  If the
              line is empty, the words and prompt are displayed again.  If EOF is read, the command completes.  Any other value read causes name to be set to null.  The
              line  read is saved in the variable REPLY.  The list is executed after each selection until a break command is executed.  The exit status of select is the
              exit status of the last command executed in list, or zero if no commands were executed.

       case word in [ [(] pattern [ | pattern ] ... ) list ;; ] ... esac
              A case command first expands word, and tries to match it against each pattern in turn, using the matching rules described under  Pattern  Matching  below.
              The  word  is expanded using tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, command substitution, process substitution and quote
              removal.  Each pattern examined is expanded using tilde expansion, parameter and variable  expansion,  arithmetic  expansion,  command  substitution,  and
              process  substitution.   If  the  nocasematch shell option is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters.  When a
              match is found, the corresponding list is executed.  If the ;; operator is used, no subsequent matches are attempted after the first pattern match.  Using
              ;&  in place of ;; causes execution to continue with the list associated with the next set of patterns.  Using ;;& in place of ;; causes the shell to test
              the next pattern list in the statement, if any, and execute any associated list on a successful match, continuing the case statement execution as  if  the
              pattern list had not matched.  The exit status is zero if no pattern matches.  Otherwise, it is the exit status of the last command executed in list.

       if list; then list; [ elif list; then list; ] ... [ else list; ] fi
              The if list is executed.  If its exit status is zero, the then list is executed.  Otherwise, each elif list is executed in turn, and if its exit status is
              zero, the corresponding then list is executed and the command completes.  Otherwise, the else list is executed, if present.  The exit status is  the  exit
              status of the last command executed, or zero if no condition tested true.

       while list-1; do list-2; done
       until list-1; do list-2; done
              The  while command continuously executes the list list-2 as long as the last command in the list list-1 returns an exit status of zero.  The until command
              is identical to the while command, except that the test is negated: list-2 is executed as long as the last command in list-1 returns a non-zero exit  sta‐
              tus.  The exit status of the while and until commands is the exit status of the last command executed in list-2, or zero if none was executed.

   Coprocesses: -
   -----------
       A coprocess is a shell command preceded by the coproc reserved word.  A coprocess is executed asynchronously in a subshell, as if the command had been terminated
       with the & control operator, with a two-way pipe established between the executing shell and the coprocess.

       The format for a coprocess is:

              coproc [NAME] command [redirections]

       This creates a coprocess named NAME.  If NAME is not supplied, the default name is COPROC.  NAME must not be supplied if command is a simple command (see above);
       otherwise,  it  is  interpreted  as the first word of the simple command.  When the coprocess is executed, the shell creates an array variable (see Arrays below)
       named NAME in the context of the executing shell.  The standard output of command is connected via a pipe to a file descriptor in the executing shell,  and  that
       file  descriptor  is  assigned  to NAME[0].  The standard input of command is connected via a pipe to a file descriptor in the executing shell, and that file de‐
       scriptor is assigned to NAME[1].  This pipe is established before any redirections specified by the command (see REDIRECTION below).  The file descriptors can be
       utilized  as arguments to shell commands and redirections using standard word expansions.  Other than those created to execute command and process substitutions,
       the file descriptors are not available in subshells.  The process ID of the shell spawned to execute the coprocess is available as  the  value  of  the  variable
       NAME_PID.  The wait builtin command may be used to wait for the coprocess to terminate.

       Since  the  coprocess  is  created as an asynchronous command, the coproc command always returns success.  The return status of a coprocess is the exit status of
       command.

   Shell Function Definitions: -
   --------------------------
       A shell function is an object that is called like a simple command and executes a compound command with a new set of positional parameters.  Shell functions  are
       declared as follows:

       fname () compound-command [redirection]
       function fname [()] compound-command [redirection]
              This  defines  a  function named fname.  The reserved word function is optional.  If the function reserved word is supplied, the parentheses are optional.
              The body of the function is the compound command compound-command (see Compound Commands above).  That command is usually a list of commands between { and
              },  but  may  be  any command listed under Compound Commands above, with one exception: If the function reserved word is used, but the parentheses are not
              supplied, the braces are required.  compound-command is executed whenever fname is specified as the name of a simple command.  When in posix  mode,  fname
              must  be a valid shell name and may not be the name of one of the POSIX special builtins.  In default mode, a function name can be any unquoted shell word
              that does not contain $.  Any redirections (see REDIRECTION below) specified when a function is defined are performed when the function is executed.   The
              exit  status  of  a function definition is zero unless a syntax error occurs or a readonly function with the same name already exists.  When executed, the
              exit status of a function is the exit status of the last command executed in the body.  (See FUNCTIONS below.)

[COMMENTS]
       1. A word beginning with # causes that word and all remaining characters on that line to be ignored. 
       2. An interactive shell without the interactive_comments option which is bydefault enabled does not allow comments.

[QUOTING]
       1. It is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to the shell.  
       2. It can be used to disable special treatment for special characters, prevent reserved words and parameter expansion from being recognized.

       Each of the metacharacters listed above under DEFINITIONS has special meaning to the shell and must be quoted if it is to represent itself.

       When the command history expansion facilities are being used (see HISTORY EXPANSION below), the history expansion character, usually !, must be quoted to prevent
       history expansion.

       There are three quoting mechanisms: the escape character, single quotes, and double quotes.

       A non-quoted backslash (\) is the escape character.  It preserves the literal value of the next character that follows, with the exception of  <newline>.   If  a
       \<newline>  pair  appears, and the backslash is not itself quoted, the \<newline> is treated as a line continuation (that is, it is removed from the input stream
       and effectively ignored).

       Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes.  A single quote may not occur between single quotes,  even
       when preceded by a backslash.

       Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of $, `, \, and, when history expansion
       is enabled, !.  When the shell is in posix mode, the ! has no special meaning within double quotes, even when history expansion is enabled.  The characters $ and
       `  retain  their special meaning within double quotes.  The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the following characters: $, `, ",
       \, or <newline>.  A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it with a backslash.  If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless  an
       !  appearing in double quotes is escaped using a backslash.  The backslash preceding the !  is not removed.

       The special parameters * and @ have special meaning when in double quotes (see PARAMETERS below).

       Words  of  the form $'string' are treated specially.  The word expands to string, with backslash-escaped characters replaced as specified by the ANSI C standard.
       Backslash escape sequences, if present, are decoded as follows:
              \a     alert (bell)
              \b     backspace
              \e
              \E     an escape character
              \f     form feed
              \n     new line
              \r     carriage return
              \t     horizontal tab
              \v     vertical tab
              \\     backslash
              \'     single quote
              \"     double quote
              \?     question mark
              \nnn   the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value nnn (one to three octal digits)
              \xHH   the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value HH (one or two hex digits)
              \uHHHH the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHH (one to four hex digits)
              \UHHHHHHHH
                     the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHHHHHH (one to eight hex digits)
              \cx    a control-x character

       The expanded result is single-quoted, as if the dollar sign had not been present.

       A double-quoted string preceded by a dollar sign ($"string") will cause the string to be translated according to the current locale.  The gettext  infrastructure
       performs  the message catalog lookup and translation, using the LC_MESSAGES and TEXTDOMAIN shell variables.  If the current locale is C or POSIX, or if there are
       no translations available, the dollar sign is ignored.  If the string is translated and replaced, the replacement is double-quoted.

[PARAMETERS]
       A parameter is an entity that stores values.  It can be a name, a number, or one of the special characters listed below under Special Parameters.  A variable  is
       a parameter denoted by a name.  A variable has a value and zero or more attributes.  Attributes are assigned using the declare builtin command (see declare below
       in SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS).

       A parameter is set if it has been assigned a value.  The null string is a valid value.  Once a variable is set, it may be unset only by using the  unset  builtin
       command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).

       A variable may be assigned to by a statement of the form

              name=[value]

       If  value  is  not  given, the variable is assigned the null string.  All values undergo tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution,
       arithmetic expansion, and quote removal (see EXPANSION below).  If the variable has its integer attribute set, then value is evaluated as an  arithmetic  expres‐
       sion even if the $((...)) expansion is not used (see Arithmetic Expansion below).  Word splitting is not performed, with the exception of "$@" as explained below
       under Special Parameters.  Pathname expansion is not performed.  Assignment statements may also appear as arguments to the alias, declare, typeset, export, read‐
       only,  and  local builtin commands (declaration commands).  When in posix mode, these builtins may appear in a command after one or more instances of the command
       builtin and retain these assignment statement properties.

       In the context where an assignment statement is assigning a value to a shell variable or array index, the += operator can be used to append  to  or  add  to  the
       variable's previous value.  This includes arguments to builtin commands such as declare that accept assignment statements (declaration commands).  When += is ap‐
       plied to a variable for which the integer attribute has been set, value is evaluated as an arithmetic expression and added to the variable's current value, which
       is  also evaluated.  When += is applied to an array variable using compound assignment (see Arrays below), the variable's value is not unset (as it is when using
       =), and new values are appended to the array beginning at one greater than the array's maximum index (for indexed arrays) or added as additional key-value  pairs
       in an associative array.  When applied to a string-valued variable, value is expanded and appended to the variable's value.

       A  variable  can be assigned the nameref attribute using the -n option to the declare or local builtin commands (see the descriptions of declare and local below)
       to create a nameref, or a reference to another variable.  This allows variables to be manipulated indirectly.  Whenever the nameref variable is  referenced,  as‐
       signed to, unset, or has its attributes modified (other than using or changing the nameref attribute itself), the operation is actually performed on the variable
       specified by the nameref variable's value.  A nameref is commonly used within shell functions to refer to a variable whose name is passed as an argument  to  the
       function.  For instance, if a variable name is passed to a shell function as its first argument, running
              declare -n ref=$1
       inside the function creates a nameref variable ref whose value is the variable name passed as the first argument.  References and assignments to ref, and changes
       to its attributes, are treated as references, assignments, and attribute modifications to the variable whose name was passed as $1.  If the control variable in a
       for  loop  has  the nameref attribute, the list of words can be a list of shell variables, and a name reference will be established for each word in the list, in
       turn, when the loop is executed.  Array variables cannot be given the nameref attribute.  However, nameref variables  can  reference  array  variables  and  sub‐
       scripted  array  variables.  Namerefs can be unset using the -n option to the unset builtin.  Otherwise, if unset is executed with the name of a nameref variable
       as an argument, the variable referenced by the nameref variable will be unset.

   Positional Parameters
       A positional parameter is a parameter denoted by one or more digits, other than the single digit 0.  Positional parameters are assigned from  the  shell's  argu‐
       ments when it is invoked, and may be reassigned using the set builtin command.  Positional parameters may not be assigned to with assignment statements.  The po‐
       sitional parameters are temporarily replaced when a shell function is executed (see FUNCTIONS below).

       When a positional parameter consisting of more than a single digit is expanded, it must be enclosed in braces (see EXPANSION below).

   Special Parameters
       The shell treats several parameters specially.  These parameters may only be referenced; assignment to them is not allowed.
       *      Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one.  When the expansion is not within double quotes, each positional parameter expands to a  separate
              word.  In contexts where it is performed, those words are subject to further word splitting and pathname expansion.  When the expansion occurs within dou‐
              ble quotes, it expands to a single word with the value of each parameter separated by the first character of the IFS special variable.  That is,  "$*"  is
              equivalent  to "$1c$2c...", where c is the first character of the value of the IFS variable.  If IFS is unset, the parameters are separated by spaces.  If
              IFS is null, the parameters are joined without intervening separators.
       @      Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one.  In contexts where word splitting is performed, this expands each positional parameter to a sepa‐
              rate  word;  if not within double quotes, these words are subject to word splitting.  In contexts where word splitting is not performed, this expands to a
              single word with each positional parameter separated by a space.  When the expansion occurs within double quotes, each parameter  expands  to  a  separate
              word.   That  is, "$@" is equivalent to "$1" "$2" ...  If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the first parameter is joined
              with the beginning part of the original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with the last part of the original word.  When  there  are
              no positional parameters, "$@" and $@ expand to nothing (i.e., they are removed).
       #      Expands to the number of positional parameters in decimal.
       ?      Expands to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
       -      Expands to the current option flags as specified upon invocation, by the set builtin command, or those set by the shell itself (such as the -i option).
       $      Expands to the process ID of the shell.  In a () subshell, it expands to the process ID of the current shell, not the subshell.
       !      Expands  to  the  process ID of the job most recently placed into the background, whether executed as an asynchronous command or using the bg builtin (see
              JOB CONTROL below).
       0      Expands to the name of the shell or shell script.  This is set at shell initialization.  If bash is invoked with a file of commands, $0 is set to the name
              of that file.  If bash is started with the -c option, then $0 is set to the first argument after the string to be executed, if one is present.  Otherwise,
              it is set to the filename used to invoke bash, as given by argument zero.

[Arrays]
       Bash provides one-dimensional indexed and associative array variables.  Any variable may be used as an indexed array; the declare builtin will explicitly declare
       an  array.   There  is no maximum limit on the size of an array, nor any requirement that members be indexed or assigned contiguously.  Indexed arrays are refer‐
       enced using integers (including arithmetic expressions) and are zero-based; associative arrays are referenced using arbitrary strings.  Unless  otherwise  noted,
       indexed array indices must be non-negative integers.

       An  indexed  array is created automatically if any variable is assigned to using the syntax name[subscript]=value.  The subscript is treated as an arithmetic ex‐
       pression that must evaluate to a number.  To explicitly declare an indexed array, use declare -a name (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  declare  -a  name[sub‐
       script] is also accepted; the subscript is ignored.

       Associative arrays are created using declare -A name.

       Attributes may be specified for an array variable using the declare and readonly builtins.  Each attribute applies to all members of an array.

       Arrays  are  assigned  to using compound assignments of the form name=(value1 ... valuen), where each value may be of the form [subscript]=string.  Indexed array
       assignments do not require anything but string.  Each value in the list is expanded using all the shell expansions described below under EXPANSION.  When assign‐
       ing  to  indexed  arrays, if the optional brackets and subscript are supplied, that index is assigned to; otherwise the index of the element assigned is the last
       index assigned to by the statement plus one.  Indexing starts at zero.

       When assigning to an associative array, the words in a compound assignment may be either assignment statements, for which the subscript is required, or a list of
       words  that  is  interpreted  as  a  sequence  of  alternating  keys  and  values:  name=( key1 value1 key2 value2 ...).  These are treated identically to name=(
       [key1]=value1 [key2]=value2 ...).  The first word in the list determines how the remaining words are interpreted; all assignments in a list must be of  the  same
       type.  When using key/value pairs, the keys may not be missing or empty; a final missing value is treated like the empty string.

       This syntax is also accepted by the declare builtin.  Individual array elements may be assigned to using the name[subscript]=value syntax introduced above.  When
       assigning to an indexed array, if name is subscripted by a negative number, that number is interpreted as relative to one greater than the maximum index of name,
       so negative indices count back from the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the last element.

       Any element of an array may be referenced using ${name[subscript]}.  The braces are required to avoid conflicts with pathname expansion.  If subscript is @ or *,
       the word expands to all members of name.  These subscripts differ only when the word appears within double quotes.  If the word is double-quoted, ${name[*]}  ex‐
       pands  to  a single word with the value of each array member separated by the first character of the IFS special variable, and ${name[@]} expands each element of
       name to a separate word.  When there are no array members, ${name[@]} expands to nothing.  If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the expansion  of
       the  first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with the last part of the original
       word.  This is analogous to the expansion of the special parameters * and @ (see Special  Parameters  above).   ${#name[subscript]}  expands  to  the  length  of
       ${name[subscript]}.   If  subscript is * or @, the expansion is the number of elements in the array.  If the subscript used to reference an element of an indexed
       array evaluates to a number less than zero, it is interpreted as relative to one greater than the maximum index of the array, so negative indices count back from
       the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the last element.

       Referencing  an  array variable without a subscript is equivalent to referencing the array with a subscript of 0.  Any reference to a variable using a valid sub‐
       script is legal, and bash will create an array if necessary.

       An array variable is considered set if a subscript has been assigned a value.  The null string is a valid value.

       It is possible to obtain the keys (indices) of an array as well as the values.  ${!name[@]} and ${!name[*]} expand to the  indices  assigned  in  array  variable
       name.  The treatment when in double quotes is similar to the expansion of the special parameters @ and * within double quotes.

       The unset builtin is used to destroy arrays.  unset name[subscript] destroys the array element at index subscript, for both indexed and associative arrays.  Neg‐
       ative subscripts to indexed arrays are interpreted as described above.  Unsetting the last element of an array variable does not unset the variable.  unset name,
       where name is an array, or unset name[subscript], where subscript is * or @, removes the entire array.

       When  using  a variable name with a subscript as an argument to a command, such as with unset, without using the word expansion syntax described above, the argu‐
       ment is subject to pathname expansion.  If pathname expansion is not desired, the argument should be quoted.

       The declare, local, and readonly builtins each accept a -a option to specify an indexed array and a -A option to specify an associative array.  If  both  options
       are supplied, -A takes precedence.  The read builtin accepts a -a option to assign a list of words read from the standard input to an array.  The set and declare
       builtins display array values in a way that allows them to be reused as assignments.

[EXPANSION]
       Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been split into words.  There are seven kinds of expansion performed: brace expansion,  tilde  expansion,
       parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion.

       The  order  of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command substitution (done in a left-
       to-right fashion); word splitting; and pathname expansion.

       On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion available: process substitution.  This is performed at the same time as tilde, parameter,  vari‐
       able, and arithmetic expansion and command substitution.

       After these expansions are performed, quote characters present in the original word are removed unless they have been quoted themselves (quote removal).

       Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion can increase the number of words of the expansion; other expansions expand a single word to a single
       word.  The only exceptions to this are the expansions of "$@" and "${name[@]}", and, in most cases, $* and ${name[*]} as explained above (see PARAMETERS).

   Brace Expansion
       Brace expansion is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated.  This mechanism is similar to pathname expansion, but the  filenames  generated  need
       not  exist.  Patterns to be brace expanded take the form of an optional preamble, followed by either a series of comma-separated strings or a sequence expression
       between a pair of braces, followed by an optional postscript.  The preamble is prefixed to each string contained within the braces, and the  postscript  is  then
       appended to each resulting string, expanding left to right.

       Brace  expansions may be nested.  The results of each expanded string are not sorted; left to right order is preserved.  For example, a{d,c,b}e expands into `ade
       ace abe'.

       A sequence expression takes the form {x..y[..incr]}, where x and y are either integers or single characters, and incr, an  optional  increment,  is  an  integer.
       When  integers  are  supplied,  the expression expands to each number between x and y, inclusive.  Supplied integers may be prefixed with 0 to force each term to
       have the same width.  When either x or y begins with a zero, the shell attempts to force all generated terms to contain the same number of  digits,  zero-padding
       where  necessary.   When  characters are supplied, the expression expands to each character lexicographically between x and y, inclusive, using the default C lo‐
       cale.  Note that both x and y must be of the same type.  When the increment is supplied, it is used as the difference between each term.  The  default  increment
       is 1 or -1 as appropriate.

       Brace  expansion  is  performed before any other expansions, and any characters special to other expansions are preserved in the result.  It is strictly textual.
       Bash does not apply any syntactic interpretation to the context of the expansion or the text between the braces.

       A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening and closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma or a valid sequence expression.  Any  incor‐
       rectly  formed  brace expansion is left unchanged.  A { or , may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its being considered part of a brace expression.  To avoid
       conflicts with parameter expansion, the string ${ is not considered eligible for brace expansion, and inhibits brace expansion until the closing }.

       This construct is typically used as shorthand when the common prefix of the strings to be generated is longer than in the above example:

              mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}
       or
              chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}

       Brace expansion introduces a slight incompatibility with historical versions of sh.  sh does not treat opening or closing braces specially when  they  appear  as
       part  of  a  word,  and  preserves them in the output.  Bash removes braces from words as a consequence of brace expansion.  For example, a word entered to sh as
       file{1,2} appears identically in the output.  The same word is output as file1 file2 after expansion by bash.  If strict compatibility with sh is desired,  start
       bash with the +B option or disable brace expansion with the +B option to the set command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).

   Tilde Expansion
       If  a  word  begins  with an unquoted tilde character (`~'), all of the characters preceding the first unquoted slash (or all characters, if there is no unquoted
       slash) are considered a tilde-prefix.  If none of the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in  the  tilde-prefix  following  the  tilde  are
       treated  as  a  possible login name.  If this login name is the null string, the tilde is replaced with the value of the shell parameter HOME.  If HOME is unset,
       the home directory of the user executing the shell is substituted instead.  Otherwise, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the home directory associated  with  the
       specified login name.

       If  the  tilde-prefix  is  a `~+', the value of the shell variable PWD replaces the tilde-prefix.  If the tilde-prefix is a `~-', the value of the shell variable
       OLDPWD, if it is set, is substituted.  If the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number N, optionally prefixed by a `+'  or  a  `-',
       the  tilde-prefix is replaced with the corresponding element from the directory stack, as it would be displayed by the dirs builtin invoked with the tilde-prefix
       as an argument.  If the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number without a leading `+' or `-', `+' is assumed.

       If the login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the word is unchanged.

       Each variable assignment is checked for unquoted tilde-prefixes immediately following a : or the first =.  In these cases, tilde  expansion  is  also  performed.
       Consequently, one may use filenames with tildes in assignments to PATH, MAILPATH, and CDPATH, and the shell assigns the expanded value.

       Bash also performs tilde expansion on words satisfying the conditions of variable assignments (as described above under PARAMETERS) when they appear as arguments
       to simple commands.  Bash does not do this, except for the declaration commands listed above, when in posix mode.

   Parameter Expansion
       The `$' character introduces parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic expansion.  The parameter name or symbol to be expanded may be enclosed  in
       braces,  which  are  optional but serve to protect the variable to be expanded from characters immediately following it which could be interpreted as part of the
       name.

       When braces are used, the matching ending brace is the first `}' not escaped by a backslash or within a quoted string, and not within an embedded arithmetic  ex‐
       pansion, command substitution, or parameter expansion.

       ${parameter}
              The  value  of  parameter is substituted.  The braces are required when parameter is a positional parameter with more than one digit, or when parameter is
              followed by a character which is not to be interpreted as part of its name.  The parameter is a shell parameter as described above PARAMETERS) or an array
              reference (Arrays).

       If  the  first  character  of  parameter  is an exclamation point (!), and parameter is not a nameref, it introduces a level of indirection.  Bash uses the value
       formed by expanding the rest of parameter as the new parameter; this is then expanded and that value is used in the rest of the expansion, rather than the expan‐
       sion  of  the  original parameter.  This is known as indirect expansion.  The value is subject to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and
       arithmetic expansion.  If parameter is a nameref, this expands to the name of the parameter referenced by parameter instead of performing the  complete  indirect
       expansion.   The  exceptions  to  this are the expansions of ${!prefix*} and ${!name[@]} described below.  The exclamation point must immediately follow the left
       brace in order to introduce indirection.

       In each of the cases below, word is subject to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.

       When not performing substring expansion, using the forms documented below (e.g., :-), bash tests for a parameter that is unset or null.  Omitting the  colon  re‐
       sults in a test only for a parameter that is unset.

       ${parameter:-word}
              Use Default Values.  If parameter is unset or null, the expansion of word is substituted.  Otherwise, the value of parameter is substituted.
       ${parameter:=word}
              Assign Default Values.  If parameter is unset or null, the expansion of word is assigned to parameter.  The value of parameter is then substituted.  Posi‐
              tional parameters and special parameters may not be assigned to in this way.
       ${parameter:?word}
              Display Error if Null or Unset.  If parameter is null or unset, the expansion of word (or a message to that effect if word is not present) is  written  to
              the standard error and the shell, if it is not interactive, exits.  Otherwise, the value of parameter is substituted.
       ${parameter:+word}
              Use Alternate Value.  If parameter is null or unset, nothing is substituted, otherwise the expansion of word is substituted.
       ${parameter:offset}
       ${parameter:offset:length}
              Substring  Expansion.   Expands to up to length characters of the value of parameter starting at the character specified by offset.  If parameter is @, an
              indexed array subscripted by @ or *, or an associative array name, the results differ as described below.  If length is omitted, expands to the  substring
              of  the  value of parameter starting at the character specified by offset and extending to the end of the value.  length and offset are arithmetic expres‐
              sions (see ARITHMETIC EVALUATION below).

              If offset evaluates to a number less than zero, the value is used as an offset in characters from the end of the value of parameter.  If length  evaluates
              to  a  number  less than zero, it is interpreted as an offset in characters from the end of the value of parameter rather than a number of characters, and
              the expansion is the characters between offset and that result.  Note that a negative offset must be separated from the colon by at  least  one  space  to
              avoid being confused with the :- expansion.

              If  parameter  is @, the result is length positional parameters beginning at offset.  A negative offset is taken relative to one greater than the greatest
              positional parameter, so an offset of -1 evaluates to the last positional parameter.  It is an expansion error if length evaluates to a number  less  than
              zero.

              If  parameter  is an indexed array name subscripted by @ or *, the result is the length members of the array beginning with ${parameter[offset]}.  A nega‐
              tive offset is taken relative to one greater than the maximum index of the specified array.  It is an expansion error if length evaluates to a number less
              than zero.

              Substring expansion applied to an associative array produces undefined results.

              Substring  indexing  is  zero-based unless the positional parameters are used, in which case the indexing starts at 1 by default.  If offset is 0, and the
              positional parameters are used, $0 is prefixed to the list.

       ${!prefix*}
       ${!prefix@}
              Names matching prefix.  Expands to the names of variables whose names begin with prefix, separated by the first character of  the  IFS  special  variable.
              When @ is used and the expansion appears within double quotes, each variable name expands to a separate word.

       ${!name[@]}
       ${!name[*]}
              List of array keys.  If name is an array variable, expands to the list of array indices (keys) assigned in name.  If name is not an array, expands to 0 if
              name is set and null otherwise.  When @ is used and the expansion appears within double quotes, each key expands to a separate word.

       ${#parameter}
              Parameter length.  The length in characters of the value of parameter is substituted.  If parameter is * or @, the value substituted is the number of  po‐
              sitional  parameters.  If parameter is an array name subscripted by * or @, the value substituted is the number of elements in the array.  If parameter is
              an indexed array name subscripted by a negative number, that number is interpreted as relative to one greater than the maximum index of parameter, so neg‐
              ative indices count back from the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the last element.

       ${parameter#word}
       ${parameter##word}
              Remove matching prefix pattern.  The word is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname expansion, and matched against the expanded value of param‐
              eter using the rules described under Pattern Matching below.  If the pattern matches the beginning of the value of parameter, then the result of  the  ex‐
              pansion  is the expanded value of parameter with the shortest matching pattern (the ``#'' case) or the longest matching pattern (the ``##'' case) deleted.
              If parameter is @ or *, the pattern removal operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.  If param‐
              eter  is an array variable subscripted with @ or *, the pattern removal operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the
              resultant list.

       ${parameter%word}
       ${parameter%%word}
              Remove matching suffix pattern.  The word is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname expansion, and matched against the expanded value of param‐
              eter  using  the rules described under Pattern Matching below.  If the pattern matches a trailing portion of the expanded value of parameter, then the re‐
              sult of the expansion is the expanded value of parameter with the shortest matching pattern (the ``%'' case) or the longest matching pattern  (the  ``%%''
              case)  deleted.  If parameter is @ or *, the pattern removal operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant
              list.  If parameter is an array variable subscripted with @ or *, the pattern removal operation is applied to each member of the array in  turn,  and  the
              expansion is the resultant list.

       ${parameter/pattern/string}
              Pattern  substitution.  The pattern is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname expansion, Parameter is expanded and the longest match of pattern
              against its value is replaced with string.  The match is performed using the rules described under Pattern Matching below.  If pattern begins with /,  all
              matches  of pattern are replaced with string.  Normally only the first match is replaced.  If pattern begins with #, it must match at the beginning of the
              expanded value of parameter.  If pattern begins with %, it must match at the end of the expanded value of parameter.  If string is null, matches  of  pat‐
              tern  are  deleted  and  the / following pattern may be omitted.  If the nocasematch shell option is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the
              case of alphabetic characters.  If parameter is @ or *, the substitution operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the  expansion  is
              the resultant list.  If parameter is an array variable subscripted with @ or *, the substitution operation is applied to each member of the array in turn,
              and the expansion is the resultant list.

       ${parameter^pattern}
       ${parameter^^pattern}
       ${parameter,pattern}
       ${parameter,,pattern}
              Case modification.  This expansion modifies the case of alphabetic characters in parameter.  The pattern is expanded to produce a pattern just as in path‐
              name  expansion.  Each character in the expanded value of parameter is tested against pattern, and, if it matches the pattern, its case is converted.  The
              pattern should not attempt to match more than one character.  The ^ operator converts lowercase letters matching pattern to uppercase; the , operator con‐
              verts  matching  uppercase  letters  to  lowercase.  The ^^ and ,, expansions convert each matched character in the expanded value; the ^ and , expansions
              match and convert only the first character in the expanded value.  If pattern is omitted, it is treated like a ?, which matches every character.   If  pa‐
              rameter is @ or *, the case modification operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.  If parameter
              is an array variable subscripted with @ or *, the case modification operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the re‐
              sultant list.

       ${parameter@operator}
              Parameter  transformation.   The  expansion  is  either a transformation of the value of parameter or information about parameter itself, depending on the
              value of operator.  Each operator is a single letter:

              U      The expansion is a string that is the value of parameter with lowercase alphabetic characters converted to uppercase.
              u      The expansion is a string that is the value of parameter with the first character converted to uppercase, if it is alphabetic.
              L      The expansion is a string that is the value of parameter with uppercase alphabetic characters converted to lowercase.
              Q      The expansion is a string that is the value of parameter quoted in a format that can be reused as input.
              E      The expansion is a string that is the value of parameter with backslash escape sequences expanded as with the $'...' quoting mechanism.
              P      The expansion is a string that is the result of expanding the value of parameter as if it were a prompt string (see PROMPTING below).
              A      The expansion is a string in the form of an assignment statement or declare command that, if evaluated, will recreate parameter with its attributes
                     and value.
              K      Produces  a  possibly-quoted version of the value of parameter, except that it prints the values of indexed and associative arrays as a sequence of
                     quoted key-value pairs (see Arrays above).
              a      The expansion is a string consisting of flag values representing parameter's attributes.

              If parameter is @ or *, the operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.  If parameter is an  array
              variable subscripted with @ or *, the operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.

              The result of the expansion is subject to word splitting and pathname expansion as described below.

   Command Substitution
       Command substitution allows the output of a command to replace the command name.  There are two forms:

              $(command)
       or
              `command`

       Bash  performs  the expansion by executing command in a subshell environment and replacing the command substitution with the standard output of the command, with
       any trailing newlines deleted.  Embedded newlines are not deleted, but they may be removed during word splitting.  The command substitution $(cat  file)  can  be
       replaced by the equivalent but faster $(< file).

       When  the  old-style  backquote  form of substitution is used, backslash retains its literal meaning except when followed by $, `, or \.  The first backquote not
       preceded by a backslash terminates the command substitution.  When using the $(command) form, all characters between the parentheses make up  the  command;  none
       are treated specially.

       Command substitutions may be nested.  To nest when using the backquoted form, escape the inner backquotes with backslashes.

       If the substitution appears within double quotes, word splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the results.

   Arithmetic Expansion
       Arithmetic expansion allows the evaluation of an arithmetic expression and the substitution of the result.  The format for arithmetic expansion is:

              $((expression))

       The old format $[expression] is deprecated and will be removed in upcoming versions of bash.

       The  expression  is treated as if it were within double quotes, but a double quote inside the parentheses is not treated specially.  All tokens in the expression
       undergo parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and quote removal.  The result is treated as the arithmetic expression to be  evaluated.   Arith‐
       metic expansions may be nested.

       The  evaluation is performed according to the rules listed below under ARITHMETIC EVALUATION.  If expression is invalid, bash prints a message indicating failure
       and no substitution occurs.

   Process Substitution
       Process substitution allows a process's input or output to be referred to using a filename.  It takes the form of <(list) or >(list).  The process  list  is  run
       asynchronously, and its input or output appears as a filename.  This filename is passed as an argument to the current command as the result of the expansion.  If
       the >(list) form is used, writing to the file will provide input for list.  If the <(list) form is used, the file passed as an argument should be read to  obtain
       the output of list.  Process substitution is supported on systems that support named pipes (FIFOs) or the /dev/fd method of naming open files.

       When available, process substitution is performed simultaneously with parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.

   Word Splitting
       The shell scans the results of parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion that did not occur within double quotes for word splitting.

       The shell treats each character of IFS as a delimiter, and splits the results of the other expansions into words using these characters as field terminators.  If
       IFS is unset, or its value is exactly <space><tab><newline>, the default, then sequences of <space>, <tab>, and <newline> at the beginning and end of the results
       of  the  previous  expansions are ignored, and any sequence of IFS characters not at the beginning or end serves to delimit words.  If IFS has a value other than
       the default, then sequences of the whitespace characters space, tab, and newline are ignored at the beginning and end of the word,  as  long  as  the  whitespace
       character  is in the value of IFS (an IFS whitespace character).  Any character in IFS that is not IFS whitespace, along with any adjacent IFS whitespace charac‐
       ters, delimits a field.  A sequence of IFS whitespace characters is also treated as a delimiter.  If the value of IFS is null, no word splitting occurs.

       Explicit null arguments ("" or '') are retained and passed to commands as empty strings.  Unquoted implicit null arguments, resulting from the expansion  of  pa‐
       rameters  that have no values, are removed.  If a parameter with no value is expanded within double quotes, a null argument results and is retained and passed to
       a command as an empty string.  When a quoted null argument appears as part of a word whose expansion is non-null, the null argument is  removed.   That  is,  the
       word -d'' becomes -d after word splitting and null argument removal.

       Note that if no expansion occurs, no splitting is performed.

   Pathname Expansion
       After  word  splitting,  unless  the -f option has been set, bash scans each word for the characters *, ?, and [.  If one of these characters appears, and is not
       quoted, then the word is regarded as a pattern, and replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of filenames matching the pattern (see Pattern  Matching  below).
       If  no matching filenames are found, and the shell option nullglob is not enabled, the word is left unchanged.  If the nullglob option is set, and no matches are
       found, the word is removed.  If the failglob shell option is set, and no matches are found, an error message is printed and the command is not executed.  If  the
       shell  option nocaseglob is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters.  Note that when using range expressions like [a-
       z] (see below), letters of the other case may be included, depending on the setting of LC_COLLATE.  When a pattern is used for pathname expansion, the  character
       ``.''   at  the  start  of  a name or immediately following a slash must be matched explicitly, unless the shell option dotglob is set.  The filenames ``.''  and
       ``..''  must always be matched explicitly, even if dotglob is set.  In other cases, the ``.''  character is not treated specially.  When matching a pathname, the
       slash  character  must always be matched explicitly by a slash in the pattern, but in other matching contexts it can be matched by a special pattern character as
       described below under Pattern Matching.  See the description of shopt below under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS for a description of the nocaseglob, nullglob, failglob,
       and dotglob shell options.

       The  GLOBIGNORE shell variable may be used to restrict the set of file names matching a pattern.  If GLOBIGNORE is set, each matching file name that also matches
       one of the patterns in GLOBIGNORE is removed from the list of matches.  If the nocaseglob option is set, the matching against the patterns in GLOBIGNORE is  per‐
       formed  without  regard to case.  The filenames ``.''  and ``..''  are always ignored when GLOBIGNORE is set and not null.  However, setting GLOBIGNORE to a non-
       null value has the effect of enabling the dotglob shell option, so all other filenames beginning with a ``.''  will match.  To get the old behavior  of  ignoring
       filenames beginning with a ``.'', make ``.*''  one of the patterns in GLOBIGNORE.  The dotglob option is disabled when GLOBIGNORE is unset.  The pattern matching
       honors the setting of the extglob shell option.

       Pattern Matching

       Any character that appears in a pattern, other than the special pattern characters described below, matches itself.  The NUL character may not occur  in  a  pat‐
       tern.  A backslash escapes the following character; the escaping backslash is discarded when matching.  The special pattern characters must be quoted if they are
       to be matched literally.

       The special pattern characters have the following meanings:

              *      Matches any string, including the null string.  When the globstar shell option is enabled, and * is used in a pathname expansion context, two adja‐
                     cent  *s  used  as a single pattern will match all files and zero or more directories and subdirectories.  If followed by a /, two adjacent *s will
                     match only directories and subdirectories.
              ?      Matches any single character.
              [...]  Matches any one of the enclosed characters.  A pair of characters separated by a hyphen denotes a range expression; any character  that  falls  be‐
                     tween those two characters, inclusive, using the current locale's collating sequence and character set, is matched.  If the first character follow‐
                     ing the [ is a !  or a ^ then any character not enclosed is matched.  The sorting order of characters in range expressions  is  determined  by  the
                     current  locale and the values of the LC_COLLATE or LC_ALL shell variables, if set.  To obtain the traditional interpretation of range expressions,
                     where [a-d] is equivalent to [abcd], set value of the LC_ALL shell variable to C, or enable the globasciiranges shell option.  A - may  be  matched
                     by including it as the first or last character in the set.  A ] may be matched by including it as the first character in the set.

                     Within  [  and  ],  character classes can be specified using the syntax [:class:], where class is one of the following classes defined in the POSIX
                     standard:
                     alnum alpha ascii blank cntrl digit graph lower print punct space upper word xdigit
                     A character class matches any character belonging to that class.  The word character class matches letters, digits, and the character _.

                     Within [ and ], an equivalence class can be specified using the syntax [=c=], which matches all characters with the same collation weight  (as  de‐
                     fined by the current locale) as the character c.

                     Within [ and ], the syntax [.symbol.] matches the collating symbol symbol.

       If the extglob shell option is enabled using the shopt builtin, several extended pattern matching operators are recognized.  In the following description, a pat‐
       tern-list is a list of one or more patterns separated by a |.  Composite patterns may be formed using one or more of the following sub-patterns:

              ?(pattern-list)
                     Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns
              *(pattern-list)
                     Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns
              +(pattern-list)
                     Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns
              @(pattern-list)
                     Matches one of the given patterns
              !(pattern-list)
                     Matches anything except one of the given patterns

       Complicated extended pattern matching against long strings is slow, especially when the patterns contain alternations and the strings contain  multiple  matches.
       Using separate matches against shorter strings, or using arrays of strings instead of a single long string, may be faster.

   Quote Removal
       After the preceding expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the characters \, ', and " that did not result from one of the above expansions are removed.

[REDIRECTION]
       Before  a  command is executed, its input and output may be redirected using a special notation interpreted by the shell.  Redirection allows commands' file han‐
       dles to be duplicated, opened, closed, made to refer to different files, and can change the files the command reads from and writes to.  Redirection may also  be
       used  to modify file handles in the current shell execution environment.  The following redirection operators may precede or appear anywhere within a simple com‐
       mand or may follow a command.  Redirections are processed in the order they appear, from left to right.

       Each redirection that may be preceded by a file descriptor number may instead be preceded by a word of the form {varname}.  In this case,  for  each  redirection
       operator  except >&- and <&-, the shell will allocate a file descriptor greater than or equal to 10 and assign it to varname.  If >&- or <&- is preceded by {var‐
       name}, the value of varname defines the file descriptor to close.  If {varname} is supplied, the redirection persists beyond the scope of the  command,  allowing
       the shell programmer to manage the file descriptor himself.

       In  the following descriptions, if the file descriptor number is omitted, and the first character of the redirection operator is <, the redirection refers to the
       standard input (file descriptor 0).  If the first character of the redirection operator is >, the redirection refers to the standard output (file descriptor 1).

       The word following the redirection operator in the following descriptions, unless otherwise noted, is subjected to brace expansion,  tilde  expansion,  parameter
       and  variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, quote removal, pathname expansion, and word splitting.  If it expands to more than one word,
       bash reports an error.

       Note that the order of redirections is significant.  For example, the command

              ls > dirlist 2>&1

       directs both standard output and standard error to the file dirlist, while the command

              ls 2>&1 > dirlist

       directs only the standard output to file dirlist, because the standard error was duplicated from the standard output before the standard output was redirected to
       dirlist.

       Bash  handles several filenames specially when they are used in redirections, as described in the following table.  If the operating system on which bash is run‐
       ning provides these special files, bash will use them; otherwise it will emulate them internally with the behavior described below.

              /dev/fd/fd
                     If fd is a valid integer, file descriptor fd is duplicated.
              /dev/stdin
                     File descriptor 0 is duplicated.
              /dev/stdout
                     File descriptor 1 is duplicated.
              /dev/stderr
                     File descriptor 2 is duplicated.
              /dev/tcp/host/port
                     If host is a valid hostname or Internet address, and port is an integer port number or service name, bash attempts to open  the  corresponding  TCP
                     socket.
              /dev/udp/host/port
                     If  host  is  a valid hostname or Internet address, and port is an integer port number or service name, bash attempts to open the corresponding UDP
                     socket.

       A failure to open or create a file causes the redirection to fail.

       Redirections using file descriptors greater than 9 should be used with care, as they may conflict with file descriptors the shell uses internally.

       Note that the exec builtin command can make redirections take effect in the current shell.

   Redirecting Input
       Redirection of input causes the file whose name results from the expansion of word to be opened for reading on file descriptor n, or the standard input (file de‐
       scriptor 0) if n is not specified.

       The general format for redirecting input is:

              [n]<word

   Redirecting Output
       Redirection  of  output causes the file whose name results from the expansion of word to be opened for writing on file descriptor n, or the standard output (file
       descriptor 1) if n is not specified.  If the file does not exist it is created; if it does exist it is truncated to zero size.

       The general format for redirecting output is:

              [n]>word

       If the redirection operator is >, and the noclobber option to the set builtin has been enabled, the redirection will fail if the file whose name results from the
       expansion  of word exists and is a regular file.  If the redirection operator is >|, or the redirection operator is > and the noclobber option to the set builtin
       command is not enabled, the redirection is attempted even if the file named by word exists.

   Appending Redirected Output
       Redirection of output in this fashion causes the file whose name results from the expansion of word to be opened for appending on file descriptor n, or the stan‐
       dard output (file descriptor 1) if n is not specified.  If the file does not exist it is created.

       The general format for appending output is:

              [n]>>word

   Redirecting Standard Output and Standard Error
       This  construct  allows both the standard output (file descriptor 1) and the standard error output (file descriptor 2) to be redirected to the file whose name is
       the expansion of word.

       There are two formats for redirecting standard output and standard error:

              &>word
       and
              >&word

       Of the two forms, the first is preferred.  This is semantically equivalent to

              >word 2>&1

       When using the second form, word may not expand to a number or -.  If it does, other redirection operators apply (see Duplicating  File  Descriptors  below)  for
       compatibility reasons.

   Appending Standard Output and Standard Error
       This construct allows both the standard output (file descriptor 1) and the standard error output (file descriptor 2) to be appended to the file whose name is the
       expansion of word.

       The format for appending standard output and standard error is:

              &>>word

       This is semantically equivalent to

              >>word 2>&1

       (see Duplicating File Descriptors below).

   Here Documents
       This type of redirection instructs the shell to read input from the current source until a line containing only delimiter (with no trailing blanks) is seen.  All
       of the lines read up to that point are then used as the standard input (or file descriptor n if n is specified) for a command.

       The format of here-documents is:

              [n]<<[-]word
                      here-document
              delimiter

       No  parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, or pathname expansion is performed on word.  If any part of word is quoted, the
       delimiter is the result of quote removal on word, and the lines in the here-document are not expanded.  If word is unquoted, all lines of the  here-document  are
       subjected  to  parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion, the character sequence \<newline> is ignored, and \ must be used to quote the
       characters \, $, and `.

       If the redirection operator is <<-, then all leading tab characters are stripped from input lines and the line containing delimiter.  This allows  here-documents
       within shell scripts to be indented in a natural fashion.

   Here Strings
       A variant of here documents, the format is:

              [n]<<<word

       The word undergoes tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal.  Pathname expansion and word
       splitting are not performed.  The result is supplied as a single string, with a newline appended, to the command on its standard input (or file descriptor n if n
       is specified).

   Duplicating File Descriptors
       The redirection operator

              [n]<&word

       is  used to duplicate input file descriptors.  If word expands to one or more digits, the file descriptor denoted by n is made to be a copy of that file descrip‐
       tor.  If the digits in word do not specify a file descriptor open for input, a redirection error occurs.  If word evaluates to -, file descriptor  n  is  closed.
       If n is not specified, the standard input (file descriptor 0) is used.

       The operator

              [n]>&word

       is  used  similarly  to duplicate output file descriptors.  If n is not specified, the standard output (file descriptor 1) is used.  If the digits in word do not
       specify a file descriptor open for output, a redirection error occurs.  If word evaluates to -, file descriptor n is closed.  As a special case, if n is omitted,
       and word does not expand to one or more digits or -, the standard output and standard error are redirected as described previously.

   Moving File Descriptors
       The redirection operator

              [n]<&digit-

       moves the file descriptor digit to file descriptor n, or the standard input (file descriptor 0) if n is not specified.  digit is closed after being duplicated to
       n.

       Similarly, the redirection operator

              [n]>&digit-

       moves the file descriptor digit to file descriptor n, or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if n is not specified.

   Opening File Descriptors for Reading and Writing
       The redirection operator

              [n]<>word

       causes the file whose name is the expansion of word to be opened for both reading and writing on file descriptor n, or on file descriptor 0 if n  is  not  speci‐
       fied.  If the file does not exist, it is created.

[ALIASES]
       Aliases allow a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as the first word of a simple command.  The shell maintains a list of aliases that may be set
       and unset with the alias and unalias builtin commands (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  The first word of each simple command, if unquoted, is checked to  see
       if it has an alias.  If so, that word is replaced by the text of the alias.  The characters /, $, `, and = and any of the shell metacharacters or quoting charac‐
       ters listed above may not appear in an alias name.  The replacement text may contain any valid shell input, including shell metacharacters.  The  first  word  of
       the replacement text is tested for aliases, but a word that is identical to an alias being expanded is not expanded a second time.  This means that one may alias
       ls to ls -F, for instance, and bash does not try to recursively expand the replacement text.  If the last character of the alias value is a blank, then the  next
       command word following the alias is also checked for alias expansion.

       Aliases are created and listed with the alias command, and removed with the unalias command.

       There is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text.  If arguments are needed, a shell function should be used (see FUNCTIONS below).

       Aliases  are  not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless the expand_aliases shell option is set using shopt (see the description of shopt under SHELL
       BUILTIN COMMANDS below).

       The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are somewhat confusing.  Bash always reads at least one complete line of input, and all lines that make up
       a  compound command, before executing any of the commands on that line or the compound command.  Aliases are expanded when a command is read, not when it is exe‐
       cuted.  Therefore, an alias definition appearing on the same line as another command does not take effect until the next line of input  is  read.   The  commands
       following the alias definition on that line are not affected by the new alias.  This behavior is also an issue when functions are executed.  Aliases are expanded
       when a function definition is read, not when the function is executed, because a function definition is itself a command.  As a consequence, aliases defined in a
       function  are not available until after that function is executed.  To be safe, always put alias definitions on a separate line, and do not use alias in compound
       commands.

       For almost every purpose, aliases are superseded by shell functions.

[FUNCTIONS]
       A shell function, defined as described above under SHELL GRAMMAR, stores a series of commands for later execution.  When the name of a shell function is used  as
       a  simple  command name, the list of commands associated with that function name is executed.  Functions are executed in the context of the current shell; no new
       process is created to interpret them (contrast this with the execution of a shell script).  When a function is executed, the arguments to the function become the
       positional  parameters  during its execution.  The special parameter # is updated to reflect the change.  Special parameter 0 is unchanged.  The first element of
       the FUNCNAME variable is set to the name of the function while the function is executing.

       All other aspects of the shell execution environment are identical between a function and its caller with these exceptions: the DEBUG and RETURN traps  (see  the
       description of the trap builtin under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) are not inherited unless the function has been given the trace attribute (see the description
       of the declare builtin below) or the -o functrace shell option has been enabled with the set builtin (in which case all functions inherit the  DEBUG  and  RETURN
       traps), and the ERR trap is not inherited unless the -o errtrace shell option has been enabled.

       Variables  local  to the function may be declared with the local builtin command.  Ordinarily, variables and their values are shared between the function and its
       caller.  If a variable is declared local, the variable's visible scope is restricted to that function and its children (including the functions it calls).  Local
       variables  "shadow"  variables  with the same name declared at previous scopes.  For instance, a local variable declared in a function hides a global variable of
       the same name: references and assignments refer to the local variable, leaving the global variable unmodified.  When the function returns, the global variable is
       once again visible.

       The shell uses dynamic scoping to control a variable's visibility within functions.  With dynamic scoping, visible variables and their values are a result of the
       sequence of function calls that caused execution to reach the current function.  The value of a variable that a function sees depends on  its  value  within  its
       caller, if any, whether that caller is the "global" scope or another shell function.  This is also the value that a local variable declaration "shadows", and the
       value that is restored when the function returns.

       For example, if a variable var is declared as local in function func1, and func1 calls another function func2, references to var made from within func2 will  re‐
       solve to the local variable var from func1, shadowing any global variable named var.

       The unset builtin also acts using the same dynamic scope: if a variable is local to the current scope, unset will unset it; otherwise the unset will refer to the
       variable found in any calling scope as described above.  If a variable at the current local scope is unset, it will remain so until it is reset in that scope  or
       until the function returns.  Once the function returns, any instance of the variable at a previous scope will become visible.  If the unset acts on a variable at
       a previous scope, any instance of a variable with that name that had been shadowed will become visible.

       The FUNCNEST variable, if set to a numeric value greater than 0, defines a maximum function nesting level.  Function invocations that exceed the limit cause  the
       entire command to abort.

       If the builtin command return is executed in a function, the function completes and execution resumes with the next command after the function call.  Any command
       associated with the RETURN trap is executed before execution resumes.  When a function completes, the values of the positional parameters and the special parame‐
       ter # are restored to the values they had prior to the function's execution.

       Function  names  and  definitions may be listed with the -f option to the declare or typeset builtin commands.  The -F option to declare or typeset will list the
       function names only (and optionally the source file and line number, if the extdebug shell option is enabled).  Functions may be exported so that subshells auto‐
       matically have them defined with the -f option to the export builtin.  A function definition may be deleted using the -f option to the unset builtin.

       Functions may be recursive.  The FUNCNEST variable may be used to limit the depth of the function call stack and restrict the number of function invocations.  By
       default, no limit is imposed on the number of recursive calls.

[ARITHMETIC EVALUATION]
       The shell allows arithmetic expressions to be evaluated, under certain circumstances (see the let and declare builtin commands,  the  ((  compound  command,  and
       Arithmetic  Expansion).  Evaluation is done in fixed-width integers with no check for overflow, though division by 0 is trapped and flagged as an error.  The op‐
       erators and their precedence, associativity, and values are the same as in the C language.  The following list of operators is  grouped  into  levels  of  equal-
       precedence operators.  The levels are listed in order of decreasing precedence.

              variable post-increment and post-decrement
       - +    unary minus and plus
       ++id --id

       Shell  variables are allowed as operands; parameter expansion is performed before the expression is evaluated.  Within an expression, shell variables may also be
       referenced by name without using the parameter expansion syntax.  A shell variable that is null or unset evaluates to 0 when referenced by name without using the
       parameter  expansion syntax.  The value of a variable is evaluated as an arithmetic expression when it is referenced, or when a variable which has been given the
       integer attribute using declare -i is assigned a value.  A null value evaluates to 0.  A shell variable need not have its integer attribute turned on to be  used
       in an expression.

       Integer  constants  follow  the  C language definition, without suffixes or character constants.  Constants with a leading 0 are interpreted as octal numbers.  A
       leading 0x or 0X denotes hexadecimal.  Otherwise, numbers take the form [base#]n, where the optional base is a decimal number between 2 and 64  representing  the
       arithmetic  base,  and n is a number in that base.  If base# is omitted, then base 10 is used.  When specifying n, if a non-digit is required, the digits greater
       than 9 are represented by the lowercase letters, the uppercase letters, @, and _, in that order.  If base is less than or equal to 36,  lowercase  and  uppercase
       letters may be used interchangeably to represent numbers between 10 and 35.

       Operators are evaluated in order of precedence.  Sub-expressions in parentheses are evaluated first and may override the precedence rules above.

[CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS]
       Conditional expressions are used by the [[ compound command and the test and [ builtin commands to test file attributes and perform string and arithmetic compar‐
       isons.  The test and [ commands determine their behavior based on the number of arguments; see the descriptions of those commands for any other  command-specific
       actions.

       Expressions are formed from the following unary or binary primaries.  Bash handles several filenames specially when they are used in expressions.  If the operat‐
       ing system on which bash is running provides these special files, bash will use them; otherwise it will emulate them internally with this behavior: If  any  file
       argument to one of the primaries is of the form /dev/fd/n, then file descriptor n is checked.  If the file argument to one of the primaries is one of /dev/stdin,
       /dev/stdout, or /dev/stderr, file descriptor 0, 1, or 2, respectively, is checked.

       Unless otherwise specified, primaries that operate on files follow symbolic links and operate on the target of the link, rather than the link itself.

       When used with [[, the < and > operators sort lexicographically using the current locale.  The test command sorts using ASCII ordering.

              ing as described above (Compound Commands).

              True if string1 sorts after string2 lexicographically.

       arg1 OP arg2
              OP  is  one  of -eq, -ne, -lt, -le, -gt, or -ge.  These arithmetic binary operators return true if arg1 is equal to, not equal to, less than, less than or
              equal to, greater than, or greater than or equal to arg2, respectively.  Arg1 and arg2 may be positive or negative integers.  When used with the  [[  com‐
              mand, Arg1 and Arg2 are evaluated as arithmetic expressions (see ARITHMETIC EVALUATION above).

[SIMPLE COMMAND EXPANSION]
       When a simple command is executed, the shell performs the following expansions, assignments, and redirections, from left to right, in the following order.

       1.     The words that the parser has marked as variable assignments (those preceding the command name) and redirections are saved for later processing.

       2.     The  words that are not variable assignments or redirections are expanded.  If any words remain after expansion, the first word is taken to be the name of
              the command and the remaining words are the arguments.

       3.     Redirections are performed as described above under REDIRECTION.

       4.     The text after the = in each variable assignment undergoes tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote re‐
              moval before being assigned to the variable.

       If no command name results, the variable assignments affect the current shell environment.  Otherwise, the variables are added to the environment of the executed
       command and do not affect the current shell environment.  If any of the assignments attempts to assign a value to a readonly variable, an error occurs,  and  the
       command exits with a non-zero status.

       If  no  command name results, redirections are performed, but do not affect the current shell environment.  A redirection error causes the command to exit with a
       non-zero status.

       If there is a command name left after expansion, execution proceeds as described below.  Otherwise, the command exits.  If one of the expansions contained a com‐
       mand  substitution,  the  exit  status of the command is the exit status of the last command substitution performed.  If there were no command substitutions, the
       command exits with a status of zero.

[COMMAND EXECUTION]
       After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are taken.

       If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it.  If there exists a shell function by that name, that function is invoked  as  described
       above  in  FUNCTIONS.   If the name does not match a function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.  If a match is found, that builtin is in‐
       voked.

       If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no slashes, bash searches each element of the PATH for a directory containing  an  executable
       file  by  that  name.  Bash uses a hash table to remember the full pathnames of executable files (see hash under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  A full search of
       the directories in PATH is performed only if the command is not found in the hash table.  If the search is unsuccessful, the shell searches for a  defined  shell
       function  named  command_not_found_handle.  If that function exists, it is invoked in a separate execution environment with the original command and the original
       command's arguments as its arguments, and the function's exit status becomes the exit status of that subshell.  If that function is not defined, the shell prints
       an error message and returns an exit status of 127.

       If  the search is successful, or if the command name contains one or more slashes, the shell executes the named program in a separate execution environment.  Ar‐
       gument 0 is set to the name given, and the remaining arguments to the command are set to the arguments given, if any.

       If this execution fails because the file is not in executable format, and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a  shell  script,  a  file  containing
       shell commands.  A subshell is spawned to execute it.  This subshell reinitializes itself, so that the effect is as if a new shell had been invoked to handle the
       script, with the exception that the locations of commands remembered by the parent (see hash below under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS) are retained by the child.

       If the program is a file beginning with #!, the remainder of the first line specifies an interpreter for the program.  The shell executes  the  specified  inter‐
       preter on operating systems that do not handle this executable format themselves.  The arguments to the interpreter consist of a single optional argument follow‐
       ing the interpreter name on the first line of the program, followed by the name of the program, followed by the command arguments, if any.

[COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT]
       The shell has an execution environment, which consists of the following:

       •      open files inherited by the shell at invocation, as modified by redirections supplied to the exec builtin

       •      the current working directory as set by cd, pushd, or popd, or inherited by the shell at invocation

       •      the file creation mode mask as set by umask or inherited from the shell's parent

       •      current traps set by trap

       •      shell parameters that are set by variable assignment or with set or inherited from the shell's parent in the environment

       •      shell functions defined during execution or inherited from the shell's parent in the environment

       •      options enabled at invocation (either by default or with command-line arguments) or by set

       •      options enabled by shopt

       •      shell aliases defined with alias

       •      various process IDs, including those of background jobs, the value of $$, and the value of PPID

       When a simple command other than a builtin or shell function is to be executed, it is invoked in a separate execution environment that consists of the following.
       Unless otherwise noted, the values are inherited from the shell.

       •      the shell's open files, plus any modifications and additions specified by redirections to the command

       •      the current working directory

       •      the file creation mode mask

       •      shell variables and functions marked for export, along with variables exported for the command, passed in the environment

       •      traps caught by the shell are reset to the values inherited from the shell's parent, and traps ignored by the shell are ignored

       A command invoked in this separate environment cannot affect the shell's execution environment.

       Command  substitution,  commands grouped with parentheses, and asynchronous commands are invoked in a subshell environment that is a duplicate of the shell envi‐
       ronment, except that traps caught by the shell are reset to the values that the shell inherited from its parent at invocation.  Builtin commands that are invoked
       as part of a pipeline are also executed in a subshell environment.  Changes made to the subshell environment cannot affect the shell's execution environment.

       Subshells  spawned  to execute command substitutions inherit the value of the -e option from the parent shell.  When not in posix mode, bash clears the -e option
       in such subshells.

       If a command is followed by a & and job control is not active, the default standard input for the command is the empty file /dev/null.   Otherwise,  the  invoked
       command inherits the file descriptors of the calling shell as modified by redirections.

[ENVIRONMENT]
       When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the environment.  This is a list of name-value pairs, of the form name=value.

       The  shell  provides several ways to manipulate the environment.  On invocation, the shell scans its own environment and creates a parameter for each name found,
       automatically marking it for export to child processes.  Executed commands inherit the environment.  The export and declare  -x  commands  allow  parameters  and
       functions  to  be added to and deleted from the environment.  If the value of a parameter in the environment is modified, the new value becomes part of the envi‐
       ronment, replacing the old.  The environment inherited by any executed command consists of the shell's initial environment, whose values may be modified  in  the
       shell, less any pairs removed by the unset command, plus any additions via the export and declare -x commands.

       The  environment  for  any  simple command or function may be augmented temporarily by prefixing it with parameter assignments, as described above in PARAMETERS.
       These assignment statements affect only the environment seen by that command.

       If the -k option is set (see the set builtin command below), then all parameter assignments are placed in the environment for a command, not just those that pre‐
       cede the command name.

       When bash invokes an external command, the variable _ is set to the full filename of the command and passed to that command in its environment.

[EXIT STATUS]
       The exit status of an executed command is the value returned by the waitpid system call or equivalent function.  Exit statuses fall between 0 and 255, though, as
       explained below, the shell may use values above 125 specially.  Exit statuses from shell builtins and compound commands are also limited to  this  range.   Under
       certain circumstances, the shell will use special values to indicate specific failure modes.

       For  the  shell's purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit status has succeeded.  An exit status of zero indicates success.  A non-zero exit status indi‐
       cates failure.  When a command terminates on a fatal signal N, bash uses the value of 128+N as the exit status.

       If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it returns a status of 127.  If a command is found but is not executable, the  return  status  is
       126.

       If a command fails because of an error during expansion or redirection, the exit status is greater than zero.

       Shell builtin commands return a status of 0 (true) if successful, and non-zero (false) if an error occurs while they execute.  All builtins return an exit status
       of 2 to indicate incorrect usage, generally invalid options or missing arguments.

       Bash itself returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax error occurs, in which case it exits with a non-zero value.  See also the  exit
       builtin command below.

[SIGNALS]
       When  bash  is interactive, in the absence of any traps, it ignores SIGTERM (so that kill 0 does not kill an interactive shell), and SIGINT is caught and handled
       (so that the wait builtin is interruptible).  In all cases, bash ignores SIGQUIT.  If job control is in effect, bash ignores SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, and SIGTSTP.

       Non-builtin commands run by bash have signal handlers set to the values inherited by the shell from its parent.  When job control is not in effect,  asynchronous
       commands  ignore  SIGINT and SIGQUIT in addition to these inherited handlers.  Commands run as a result of command substitution ignore the keyboard-generated job
       control signals SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, and SIGTSTP.

       The shell exits by default upon receipt of a SIGHUP.  Before exiting, an interactive shell resends the SIGHUP to all jobs, running or stopped.  Stopped jobs  are
       sent  SIGCONT to ensure that they receive the SIGHUP.  To prevent the shell from sending the signal to a particular job, it should be removed from the jobs table
       with the disown builtin (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) or marked to not receive SIGHUP using disown -h.

       If the huponexit shell option has been set with shopt, bash sends a SIGHUP to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.

       If bash is waiting for a command to complete and receives a signal for which a trap has been set, the trap will not be  executed  until  the  command  completes.
       When bash is waiting for an asynchronous command via the wait builtin, the reception of a signal for which a trap has been set will cause the wait builtin to re‐
       turn immediately with an exit status greater than 128, immediately after which the trap is executed.

[JOB CONTROL]
       Job control refers to the ability to selectively stop (suspend) the execution of processes and continue (resume) their execution at a later point.  A user  typi‐
       cally employs this facility via an interactive interface supplied jointly by the operating system kernel's terminal driver and bash.

       The  shell associates a job with each pipeline.  It keeps a table of currently executing jobs, which may be listed with the jobs command.  When bash starts a job
       asynchronously (in the background), it prints a line that looks like:

              [1] 25647

       indicating that this job is job number 1 and that the process ID of the last process in the pipeline associated with this job is 25647.  All of the processes  in
       a single pipeline are members of the same job.  Bash uses the job abstraction as the basis for job control.

       To facilitate the implementation of the user interface to job control, the operating system maintains the notion of a current terminal process group ID.  Members
       of this process group (processes whose process group ID is equal to the current terminal process group ID) receive keyboard-generated  signals  such  as  SIGINT.
       These  processes  are said to be in the foreground.  Background processes are those whose process group ID differs from the terminal's; such processes are immune
       to keyboard-generated signals.  Only foreground processes are allowed to read from or, if the user so specifies with stty tostop, write to the  terminal.   Back‐
       ground  processes  which  attempt to read from (write to when stty tostop is in effect) the terminal are sent a SIGTTIN (SIGTTOU) signal by the kernel's terminal
       driver, which, unless caught, suspends the process.

       If the operating system on which bash is running supports job control, bash contains facilities to use it.  Typing the suspend character (typically ^Z,  Control-
       Z)  while  a  process  is  running causes that process to be stopped and returns control to bash.  Typing the delayed suspend character (typically ^Y, Control-Y)
       causes the process to be stopped when it attempts to read input from the terminal, and control to be returned to bash.  The user may then manipulate the state of
       this job, using the bg command to continue it in the background, the fg command to continue it in the foreground, or the kill command to kill it.  A ^Z takes ef‐
       fect immediately, and has the additional side effect of causing pending output and typeahead to be discarded.

       There are a number of ways to refer to a job in the shell.  The character % introduces a job specification (jobspec).  Job number n may be referred to as %n.   A
       job  may  also  be  referred to using a prefix of the name used to start it, or using a substring that appears in its command line.  For example, %ce refers to a
       stopped job whose command name begins with ce.  If a prefix matches more than one job, bash reports an error.  Using %?ce, on the other hand, refers to  any  job
       containing the string ce in its command line.  If the substring matches more than one job, bash reports an error.  The symbols %% and %+ refer to the shell's no‐
       tion of the current job, which is the last job stopped while it was in the foreground or started in the background.  The previous job may be referenced using %-.
       If there is only a single job, %+ and %- can both be used to refer to that job.  In output pertaining to jobs (e.g., the output of the jobs command), the current
       job is always flagged with a +, and the previous job with a -.  A single % (with no accompanying job specification) also refers to the current job.

       Simply naming a job can be used to bring it into the foreground: %1 is a synonym for ``fg %1'', bringing job 1 from the background into  the  foreground.   Simi‐
       larly, ``%1 &'' resumes job 1 in the background, equivalent to ``bg %1''.

       The  shell  learns immediately whenever a job changes state.  Normally, bash waits until it is about to print a prompt before reporting changes in a job's status
       so as to not interrupt any other output.  If the -b option to the set builtin command is enabled, bash reports such changes immediately.  Any trap on SIGCHLD  is
       executed for each child that exits.

       If an attempt to exit bash is made while jobs are stopped (or, if the checkjobs shell option has been enabled using the shopt builtin, running), the shell prints
       a warning message, and, if the checkjobs option is enabled, lists the jobs and their statuses.  The jobs command may then be used to inspect their status.  If  a
       second attempt to exit is made without an intervening command, the shell does not print another warning, and any stopped jobs are terminated.

       When  the  shell  is  waiting for a job or process using the wait builtin, and job control is enabled, wait will return when the job changes state. The -f option
       causes wait to wait until the job or process terminates before returning.

[PROMPTING]
       When executing interactively, bash displays the primary prompt PS1 when it is ready to read a command, and the secondary prompt PS2 when it needs more  input  to
       complete  a  command.  Bash displays PS0 after it reads a command but before executing it.  Bash displays PS4 as described above before tracing each command when
       the -x option is enabled.  Bash allows these prompt strings to be customized by inserting a number of backslash-escaped special characters that  are  decoded  as
       follows:
              \a     an ASCII bell character (07)
              \d     the date in "Weekday Month Date" format (e.g., "Tue May 26")
              \D{format}
                     the  format is passed to strftime(3) and the result is inserted into the prompt string; an empty format results in a locale-specific time represen‐
                     tation.  The braces are required
              \e     an ASCII escape character (033)
              \h     the hostname up to the first `.'
              \H     the hostname
              \j     the number of jobs currently managed by the shell
              \l     the basename of the shell's terminal device name
              \n     newline
              \r     carriage return
              \s     the name of the shell, the basename of $0 (the portion following the final slash)
              \t     the current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format
              \T     the current time in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format
              \@     the current time in 12-hour am/pm format
              \A     the current time in 24-hour HH:MM format
              \u     the username of the current user
              \v     the version of bash (e.g., 2.00)
              \V     the release of bash, version + patch level (e.g., 2.00.0)
              \w     the current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde (uses the value of the PROMPT_DIRTRIM variable)
              \W     the basename of the current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde
              \!     the history number of this command
              \#     the command number of this command
              \$     if the effective UID is 0, a #, otherwise a $
              \nnn   the character corresponding to the octal number nnn
              \\     a backslash
              \[     begin a sequence of non-printing characters, which could be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the prompt
              \]     end a sequence of non-printing characters

       The command number and the history number are usually different: the history number of a command is its position in the history list, which may include  commands
       restored  from  the history file (see HISTORY below), while the command number is the position in the sequence of commands executed during the current shell ses‐
       sion.  After the string is decoded, it is expanded via parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal, subject to  the  value
       of  the  promptvars  shell  option (see the description of the shopt command under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  This can have unwanted side effects if escaped
       portions of the string appear within command substitution or contain characters special to word expansion.

[COMPATIBILITY]
       The following table describes the behavior changes controlled by each compatibility level setting. The compatNN tag is used as shorthand for setting the compatibility level to NN using one of the following mechanisms. For versions prior to bash-5.0, the compatibility level may be set using the corresponding compatNN shopt option. For bash-4.3 and later versions, the BASH_COMPAT variable is preferred, and it is required for bash-5.1 and later versions.

       compat31
              •      quoting the rhs of the [[ command's regexp matching operator (=~) has no special effect

       compat32
              •      interrupting a command list such as "a ; b ; c" causes the execution of the next command in the list (in bash-4.0 and later versions, the shell acts as if it received the interrupt, so interrupting one command in a list aborts the execution of the entire list)

       compat40
              •      the < and > operators to the [[ command do not consider the current locale when comparing strings; they use ASCII ordering.  Bash versions prior to bash-4.1 use ASCII collation and strcmp(3); bash-4.1 and later use the current locale's collation sequence and strcoll(3).

       compat41
              •      in posix mode, time may be followed by options and still be recognized as a reserved word (this is POSIX interpretation 267)
              •      in posix mode, the parser requires that an even number of single quotes occur in the word portion of a double-quoted parameter expansion and treats them specially, so that characters within the single quotes are considered quoted (this is POSIX interpretation 221)

       compat42
              •      the replacement string in double-quoted pattern substitution does not undergo quote removal, as it does in versions after bash-4.2
              •      in posix mode, single quotes are considered special when expanding the word portion of a double-quoted parameter expansion and can be used to quote a closing brace or other special character (this is part of POSIX interpretation 221); in later versions, single quotes are not special within double-quoted word expansions

       compat43
              •      the  shell does not print a warning message if an attempt is made to use a quoted compound assignment as an argument to declare (declare -a foo='(12)'). Later versions warn that this usage is deprecated
			  •      word expansion errors are considered non-fatal errors that cause the current command to fail, even in posix mode (the default behavior is  to  make them fatal errors that cause the shell to exit)
              •      when  executing  a  shell  function,  the loop state (while/until/etc.)  is not reset, so break or continue in that function will break or continue loops in the calling context. Bash-4.4 and later reset the loop state to prevent this.

       compat44
              •      the shell sets up the values used by BASH_ARGV and BASH_ARGC so they can expand to the shell's positional parameters  even  if  extended  debugging mode is not enabled
              •      a  subshell  inherits loops from its parent context, so break or continue will cause the subshell to exit.  Bash-5.0 and later reset the loop state to prevent the exit
              •      variable assignments preceding builtins like export and readonly that set attributes continue to affect variables with the same name in the calling environment even if the shell is not in posix mode

       compat50
              •      Bash-5.1 changed the way $RANDOM is generated to introduce slightly more randomness. If the shell compatibility level is set to 50 or lower, it reverts to the method from bash-5.0 and previous versions, so seeding the random number generator by assigning a value to  RANDOM  will  produce  the same sequence as in bash-5.0
              •      If  the  command  hash  table is empty, bash versions prior to bash-5.1 printed an informational message to that effect, even when producing output that can be reused as input. Bash-5.1 suppresses that message when the -l option is supplied.
