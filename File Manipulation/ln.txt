[NAME]
       ln - make links between files

[SYNOPSIS]
       ln [OPTION]... [-T] TARGET LINK_NAME
       ln [OPTION]... TARGET
       ln [OPTION]... TARGET... DIRECTORY
       ln [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY TARGET...

[DESCRIPTION]
       In the 1st form, create a link to TARGET with the name LINK_NAME.
       In the 2nd form, create a link to TARGET in the current directory.
       In the 3rd and 4th forms, create links to each TARGET in DIRECTORY. 
       Create hard links by default, symbolic links with --symbolic.
       By default, each destination (name of new link) should not already exist.
       When creating hard links, each TARGET must exist.  
       Symbolic links can hold arbitrary text; if later resolved, a relative link is interpreted in relation to its parent directory.

[OPTIONS]
       -d, -F			create hard link directories (note: only superuser is allowed)
       -f			remove existing destination files
       -i			prompt whether to remove destinations
       -L			dereference TARGETs that are symbolic links
       -n			treat LINK_NAME as a normal file if it is a symbolic link to a directory
       -P			make hard links directly to symbolic links
       -r			with -s, create links relative to link location
       -s			make symbolic links instead of hard links
       -S SUFFIX		override the usual backup suffix
       -t DIRECTORY	       specify the DIRECTORY in which to create the links
       -T		       treat LINK_NAME as a normal file always
       -v			print name of each linked file
       --help			display this help and exit
       --version		output version information and exit

NOTE: Using -s ignores -L and -P.  Otherwise, the last option specified controls behavior when a TARGET is a symbolic link, defaulting to -P.
