To know the version of a firewall --> sudo ufw version

To know status of a firewall --> sudo ufw status
To know status of a firewall with number --> sudo ufw status numbered

Creating Rules: -
--------------

PERMISSIONS: allow | deny | reject | limit
DIRECTIONS: in | out
ADDRESS: IPv4 ADDRESS | IPv6 ADDRESS

Specific port (inside) --> sudo ufw [ PERMISSIONS ] [ DIRECTIONS ] [ PORT NAME / PORT NUMBER ]
Specific protocol (inside) --> sudo ufw [ PERMISSIONS ] [ DIRECTIONS ] [ PROTOCOL ]
Both specific port and protocol (inside) --> sudo ufw [ PERMISSIONS ] [ DIRECTIONS ] [ PROTOCOL ]/[ PORT NAME / PORT NUMBER ]
IP address (outside) --> sudo ufw [ PERMISSIONS ] from [ ADDRESS ]
IP address and port (outside) --> sudo ufw [ PERMISSIONS ] from [ ADDRESS ]/[ PORT NUMBER ]
IP address and port (outside) to specific port --> sudo ufw [ PERMISSIONS ] from [ ADDRESS ]/[ PORT NUMBER ] to any port [ PORT NUMBER ]
IP address and port (outside) to specific port, protocol --> sudo ufw [ PERMISSIONS ] proto [ PROTOCOL ] from [ ADDRESS ]/[ PORT NUMBER ] to any port [ PORT NUMBER ]
IP address and port (outside) to specific address, port, protocol --> sudo ufw [ PERMISSIONS ] proto [ PROTOCOL ] from [ ADDRESS ]/[ PORT NUMBER ] to [ ADDRESS ] port [ PORT NUMBER ]
Any address to specific port, protocol --> sudo ufw [ PERMISSIONS ] proto [ PROTOCOL ] from any to any port [ PORT NUMBER ]


Modifying Rules: -
---------------
Deleting Rules: sudo ufw delete [ SERIAL NUMBER FROM STATUS NUMBERED OUTPUT ]

NOTE: -
	1. We use --dry-run to display the change, but not to modify.
	2. We use --force to modify changes without confirmation.
	3. Defatult settings of ufw after installation: -
		(i) ufw is disabled
		(ii) incoming and forward policy is denied
		(iii) outgoing policy is allowed
	4. If no direction is specified then by default incoming direction is considered.
