Subscibe a System with the Commmand Line: -
----------------------------------------
    1. Use subscription-manager command to register a system.
    2. Use rct command inspect the certificates.

Register a system by using credential as root user	-> subscription-manager register --username [ Full Name ]
View available subscription							-> subscription-manager list --available
Auto-attach a subscription                          -> subscription-manager attach --auto
View consumed subscription							-> subscription-manager list --consumed
Unregister a system									-> subscription-manager unregister

/etc/pki/product		-> certificates indicate installed Red Hat products.
/etc/pki/consumer		-> certificates identify the Red Hat account for registration.
/etc/pki/entitlement	-> certificates indicate which subscription are attached.

Manage Software Packages with DNF: -
---------------------------------
    1. DNF (Dandified YUM) replace with YUM package manager in RHE Linux 9.
    2. YUM package is based on RPM based software installation and updates.
	3. There are 3 types of listed packages in groups of software: -
		(a) mandatory (means packages must be installed with group)
		(b) default (means packages normally installed with group)
		(c) optional (means package not be installed with group unless specifically requested)
	4. Modularity  means a single repository can host multiple  version of an application's package and its dependencies.
	5. There are 2 main software repositories: -
		(a) BaseOS		-> This repository provides the core operating system RPM packages.
		(b) AppStream	-> This repository provides content with varying lifecycle as both modules and traditional RPM packages.

To display help command											-> dnf help
To display installed and available packages						-> dnf list
To display installed and available kernel packages				-> dnf list kernel
To display information related to packages						-> dnf info [ package name ]
To display summary of package using keyword search				-> dnf seach all [ 'KEYWORD' ]
To display information of specified pathname					-> dnf provides [ path name ]

To install package									-> dnf install [ package name ]
To update specified package							-> dnf update [ package name ]
To update all package								-> dnf update
To remove package									-> dnf remove [ package name ]

To display installed and available groups						-> dnf group list
To display installed hidden groups								-> dnf group list hidden
To display information related to group							-> dnf group info [ "group name" ]
To display installed and removal transactions from log file		-> less /var/log/dnf.rpm.log
To display installed and removal transactions 					-> dnf history

To install group									-> dnf group install [ group name ]
To remove group										-> dnf group remove [ group name ]
To reverse transaction using transaction id			-> dnf history undo [ id ]

To display all available modules realated information					-> dnf module list
To display specified available module realted information				-> dnf module list [ module name ]
To display detailed information of specified module						-> dnf module info [ module name ]
To display detailed information of specified module and its packages	-> dnf module info [ module name ] --profile
To display name of module of specifed package							-> dnf module provides [ package name ]

DNF Software Repositories: -
-------------------------
	1. There are 2 ways to add third party repositories: -
		(a) Adding .repo file in /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory. [Recommended]
		(b) Adding [repository] section to /etc/dnf/dnf.conf file.
	2. Basic repo file format: -
		/etc/yum.repos.d/[ file name ].repo
		================================================
		[NAME]
		name=[ repository name ]
		baseurl=[ repository URL ]
		enabled=[ 0 | 1 ]
		gpgcheck=[ 0 | 1 ]
		gpgkey=[ GPG file URL, if gpgcheck is enabled ]
		================================================
		Note: -
		Here,
			0 -> disabled
			1 -> enabled

To display all available repositories and their status		-> dnf repolist all
To enable or disable repositories							-> dnf config-manager --[ enable | disable ] [ repository name ]
To add repositories											-> dnf config-manager --add-repo=[ "repository URL" ]
To import GPG public key									-> rpm --import [ GPG public key URL ]
To install GPG public key									-> rpm install [ GPG public key URL ]
