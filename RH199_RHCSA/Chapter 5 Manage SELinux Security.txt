Change the SELinux Enforcement Mode: -
-----------------------------------
    1. Target policy: It consist of application-specific policies that the application's developers define to declare what actions and accesses.
    2. SELinux has the following operational modes: -
        a. Enforcing (enable and deny access if violation)
        b. Permissive (enable and create warning logs)
        c. Disabled (selinux is disable)
    3. Every resources has a SELinux label which define some security policies are called SELinux content. This label has 4 fields i.e., SELinux User, Role, Type, Level.
	4. There are 4 types of context bases: -
		i.		user based (posfix _u)
		ii.		rule based (postfix _r)
		iii.	type based (postfix _t)
		iv.		sensitivity based (postifix S0)

To view selinux context file			-> ls -Z [ file path ]
To view selinux context directory		-> ls -dZ [ directory path ]
To view selinux context					-> seinfo -t
To view SELinux mode					-> getenforce
To enable SELinux to enforcing mode		-> setenforce 1
To enable SELinux to permissive mode	-> setenforce 0
SELinux configuration file				-> /etc/selinux/config

Control SELinux File Content: -
----------------------------
Command to chanage selinux context: -
	1. semanage fcontext (recommened)
	2. restorecon (recommened for relable)
	3. chcon (temporary change)

SELinux file-based directory of file labeling policies		-> /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/
To change context											-> chcon -t [ context name ] [ file or directory name ]
To restore context											-> restorecon -RFvv [ file or directory name ]
To add context using semanage fcontext						-> semanage fcontext -a -t [ context name ] [ file or directory name ]
To delete context using semanage fcontext					-> semanage fcontext -d -t [ context name ] [ file or directory name ]
To list context using semanage fcontext						-> semanage fcontext -l -l [ context name ] [ file or directory name ]

Adjust SELinux Policy with Booleans: -
-----------------------------------
To view all booleans targeted policies								-> getsebool -a
																	-> semanage boolean -l
To view booleans which has different from default settings at boot	-> semanage boolean -l -C
To view specific booleans targeted policies							-> getsebool [ context name ]
To set permenant context using booleans								-> setsebool -P [ context name ] [ on | off ]
To set temporary context using booleans								-> setsebool [ context name ] [ on | off ]

Investigate and Resolve SELinux Issues: -
--------------------------------------
SELinux troubleshooting service packages	-> setroubleshoot-server package
Access Vector Cache message log file		-> tail -f /var/log/audit/audit.log
Summary event of AVC log file				-> tail -f /var/log/messages
To set alert on even using UUID				-> sealert -l [ UUID ]
