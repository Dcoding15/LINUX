Change File and Directory User or Group Ownership: -
-------------------------------------------------
	1. To change file or folder user ownership use chown command like chown [user name]:[group name] [file / folder name] or chown [user name].[group name] [file / folder name]. It is recommended for using ' : ' instead of ' . '
	2. To change file or folder group ownership use chown or chgrp command


Manage Default Permissions and File Access: -
------------------------------------------
	1. Default permission of root user for creating file is 644 and folder is 755.
	2. Default permission of normal user for creating file is 644 and folder is 755.
	3. Default umask permission is 0022.

Permission		Description
==========		===========
   u+s			Set only on file execute as a user who owns that file.
   g+s			If set on file then execute as a group who own that file
   				If set on folder then group ownership of that folder is applied to all files (created under that folder).
   o+t			Set only on folder then user with write access can modify those files.

Calculate umask for file: -
		Initial umask			:	000		110		110		110
(XOR)	Modify umask		    :	xxx		xxx		xxx		xxx
		-------------------------------------------------------
		Result umask		    :	xxx		xxx		xxx		xxx
		-------------------------------------------------------

Calculate umask for folder: -
		Initial umask			:	000		111		111		111
(XOR)	Modify umask			:	xxx		xxx		xxx		xxx
		-------------------------------------------------------
		Result umask			:	xxx		xxx		xxx		xxx
		-------------------------------------------------------

Note: -
	For performing XOR on base 10 digits then,
		even  XOR  even  ->  +
		odd   XOR  odd   ->  -
		even  XOR  odd   ->  -
