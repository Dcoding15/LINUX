Process Control with Signals: -
----------------------------
	1. Signal is software interrupt deliveeered to processes.
	2. Signal can be an error, an external event or an explicit command or keyboard sequence.
	3. Signal has one of the following actions: -
		i. TERM -> exit program
		ii. CORE -> core dump and exit
		iii. STOP -> suspend and resume
	4. Signal through keyboard sequence: -
		i. ctrl + c		-> exit program
		ii. ctrl + \	-> core dump and exit
		iii. ctrl + z	-> suspend and resume
	5. kill command uses a PID number to send signal to a process.
	6. To display running process use ps and jobs command.
	7. To display user logins and currently running processes use w command.
	8. We can send any processes to background by using Ctrl+z and '[command name] &'.

To display background processes					-> jobs
To kill a backgroun process using kill command	-> kill -s [signal] %[job number]

To display all available signals         		-> kill -l
To kill a process using process ID       		-> kill -s [signal] [process ID]
To kill a process using naming pattern   		-> pkill -s [signal] [process naming pattern]
To kill all process and logout           		-> pkill -
To search specific process using pattern 		-> pgrep [option] [pattern]
To kill multiple process using command name		-> killall [command name]
