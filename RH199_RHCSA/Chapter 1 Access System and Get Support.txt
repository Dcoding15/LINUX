Edit text file from the Shell Prompt: -
------------------------------------
	1. Vim is an improved version of the vi editor.
	2. Vim is a highly configurable and efficient editor.
	3. Vim is by default installed on server for editing text-based files.
	4. Vim has various modes of operation: command, extended command, edit, visual.

	c[N]e / c[N]w   :   change N no. of words
	cc              :   change all character in that line
	c$              :   change character to the end of the line

	Vim Configuration Files (Permanently): -
	-----------------------
		/etc/vimrc for root user
		/home/[user name]/.vimrc for normal user

	Note: -
		1. We should always rearrange characters in visual mode.
		2. In vim delete means cut characters.

	Exercise: -
	--------
	To start exercise : lab start edit-editfile
	To end exercise   : lab finish edit-editfile

Configure SSH Key-based Authentication: -
--------------------------------------
 	1. SSH Key-based Authentication is based on Public Key Encryption (PKI).
	2. First we have to generate a pair of key.
	3. Private key which is a secret key and acts as an authentication credential.
	4. Public key which is a copied to server accounts to encrypt data securely.
	5. SSH client first receive a request in enrypted message from remote server and it try to decrypt message using associated private key from actual server. It SSH client enables to decrypt the message then verification succeeds and request is trusted.
	6. If remote server request is trusted then it can access without giving a password.
	7. During ssh key generation it is recommended to use passphrase key. Passphrase key is used to locally decrypt that encrypted private key.
	8. If there is a passphrase for private key then it will prompt at the time of private key use. SSH agent cached passphrase of private key which means we have to provide passphrase for one time after each login. After logout all cached passphrases are cleared from memory.
	9. SSH has three verbose level options i.e., -v, -vv, -vvv

	SSH Key Generation: -
	------------------
	To generate a pair of ssh key     : ssh-keygen
	To copy ssh key to remote server  : ssh-copy-id [user name]@[host name]
	To start ssh agent                : ssh-agent
	To load passphrase to key manager : ssh-add
	To access remove SSH server       : ssh [user name]@[host name]

	Note: -
	----
		1. ~/.ssh/id_rsa       --> By default store private key and have octal permission of 600
		   ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub   --> By default store public key and have octal permission of 644
		2. ~/.ssh/config       --> We can create user wide preconfiguration SSH connections file
		  /etc/ssh/ssh_config  --> We can create system wide preconfiguration SSH connections file
	
	Exercise: -
	--------
	To start exercise : lab start ssh-configure
	To end exercise : lab finish ssh-configure
