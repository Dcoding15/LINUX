Edit text file from the Shell Prompt: -
------------------------------------
	1. Vim is an improved version of the vi editor.
	2. Vim is a highly configurable and efficient editor.
	3. Vim is by default installed on server for editing text-based files.
	4. Vim has various modes of operation: command, extended command, edit, visual.

	Vim: -

	Vim Configuration Files (Permanently): -
	-----------------------
		/etc/vimrc for root user
		/home/[user name]/.vimrc for normal user

	Note: -
		1. We should always rearrange characters in visual mode.
		2. In vim delete means cut characters.

	Exercise: -
	--------
	To start exercise : lab start edit-editfile
	vimtutor
	[learn from vimtutor]
	To end exercise   : lab finish edit-editfile

Configure SSH Key-based Authentication: -
--------------------------------------
 	1. SSH Key-based Authentication is based on Public Key Encryption (PKI).
	2. First we have to generate a pair of key.
	3. Private key which is a secret key and acts as an authentication credential.
	4. Public key which is a copied to server accounts to encrypt data securely.
	5. SSH client first receive a request in enrypted message from remote server and it try to decrypt message using associated private key from actual server. It SSH client enables to decrypt the message then verification succeeds and request is trusted.
	6. If remote server request is trusted then it can access without giving a password.
	7. During ssh key generation it is recommended to use passphrase key. Passphrase key is used to locally decrypt that encrypted private key.
	8. If there is a passphrase for private key then it will prompt at the time of private key use. SSH agent cached passphrase of private key which means we have to provide passphrase for one time after each login. After logout all cached passphrases are cleared from memory.
	9. SSH has three verbose level options i.e., -v, -vv, -vvv

	SSH Key Generation: -
	------------------
	To generate a pair of ssh key     : ssh-keygen
	To copy ssh key to remote server  : ssh-copy-id [user name]@[host name]
	To start ssh agent                : ssh-agent
	To load passphrase to key manager : ssh-add
	To access remove SSH server       : ssh [user name]@[host name]

	Note: -
	----
		1. ~/.ssh/id_rsa       --> By default store private key and have octal permission of 600
		   ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub   --> By default store public key and have octal permission of 644
		2. ~/.ssh/config       --> We can create user wide preconfiguration SSH connections file
		  /etc/ssh/ssh_config  --> We can create system wide preconfiguration SSH connections file
	
	Exercise: -
	--------
	To start exercise : lab start ssh-configure
	ssh-keygen
	ssh-copy-id [user name]@[host name] (also password)
	To end exercise : lab finish ssh-configure

Create a Diagnostic Report: -
--------------------------

	Prepare Support Case: -
	--------------------
		1. State the problem and its symptoms specifically.
		2. Background information like product name and version, diagnostic information, information of 'sos report' command, system's 'kdump' crash dump.
		3. Red Hat uses four severity levels to classify issues: -
			(a) Low (severity level 4)    : problems involves low / medium to no impact on your business environment.
			(b) Medium (severity level 3) : problems involves partial / non-critical loss of use of the software in production environment or development environment.
			(c) High (severity level 2)   : problem where the software is functioning but its use in a production environment is severely reduced.
			(d)Urgent (severity level 1) : problem that severly impacts your use of the software in a production enviromment.
		4.List of information that can be collected in a report: -
			(a) The running kernel version
			(b) Loaded kernel modules
			(c) System and service configuration files
			(d) Diagnostic command output
			(e) A list of installed packages
	
	sos Report Utility: -
	------------------
	First install sos : # dnf install sos
	sos report stores : # ls -l /var/tmp/
	use sos clean     : # sos clean /var/tmp/[sos report name]
	upload sos report : # sos report --upload
		sos report  : collects various debugging information from one or more systems.
		sos collect : collect individual sos report from a specified set of nodes.
		sos clean   : make potentially sensetive information like user name, host name, IP or MAC address, etc to difficult to understand.
	
	Man pages: sosreport

	Exercise: -
	--------
	lab start support-portal
	systemctl start cockpit.socket
	systemctl status cockpit.socket
	[ create sos report and upload ]
	lab finish support-portal
