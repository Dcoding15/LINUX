systemd Daemon: -
	1. It the startup process for linux.
	2. It activates both at boot time and running system.
	3. Daemons are processes that either wait or run in the background, to perform various tasks.
	4. The first process .i.e., PID 1 is RHEL is systemd daemon.
	5. There are different types of daemons 
		i.   service unit i.e., .service for system services
		ii.  socket unit i.e., .socket for interprocess communication (IPC).
		iii. path unit i.e., .path for services that use spool directories, such as a printing system.
	6. It will bydefault takes .service files.

List units with activate state		-> systemctl list-units --type=[unit type]
List units regardless of state		-> systemctl list-units --type=[unit type] --all

To view unit status					-> systemctl status [name].[unit type]
To start unit						-> systemctl start [name].[unit type]
To stop running unit				-> systemctl stop [name].[unit type]
To restart unit						-> systemctl restart [name].[unit type]
To restart running unit				-> systemctl reload [name].[unit type]
To either restart or reload unit	-> systemctl reload-or-restart [name].[unit name]

Check whether process is active	-> systemctl is-active [name].[unit type]
Check whether process is enable	-> systemctl is-enable [name].[unit type]
Check whether process is failed	-> systemctl is-failed [name].[unit type]

List all dependencies that others depend on that process	-> systemctl list-dependencies --reverse [name].[unit type]
List all dependencies that process depend on that process	-> systemctl list-dependencies [name].[unit type]

Mask: It will create a symlink to /dev/null, so that adminstrator doesn't start it automatically.

To mask a unit 		-> systemctl mask [name].[unit type]
To unmask a unit	-> systemctl unmask [name].[unit type]

To enable unit at boot time		-> systemctl enable [name].[unit type]
To disable unit at boot time	-> systemctl disable [name].[unit type]
To enable unit at boot time and also for current session	-> systemctl enable --now [name].[unit type]
To disable unit at boot time and also for current session	-> systemctl disable --now [name].[unit type]

Red Hat Linux Enterprise 9 Boot Process: -
=======================================
	Step 1: Power on -> UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) or BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) runs POST (Power On Self Test) -> initialise hardware.
	Step 2: After hardware initialise -> search for boot devices like UEFI / BIOS firmware.
	Step 3: UEFI / BIOS firmware loads bootloader
			In Case of BIOS firmaware: -
			-------------------------
				1. It loads the bootloader stored in MBR (Master Boot Record) partition.
				2. It then looks for the bootloader stored in /boot/grub2/ directory.
				3. After loading bootloader then it load GRUB2 (GRand Unified Bootloader version 2) menu from /boot/grub2/grub.cfg .

			In Case of UEFI firmware: -
			------------------------
				1. It loads the boot loader stored in GPT (GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) Partition Table) partition.
				2. It then looks for the bootloader in EFI partition and mount UEFI partition from /boot/efi.
				3. After loading bootloader then it load GRUB2 (GRand Unified Bootoaderversion 2) menu from /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grubx64.efi .
	Step 4: After selecting kernel from grub menu, the bootloader loads the kernel and initramfs from disk and place in memory.
			Initramfs --> It is an image which is archive with kernel modules for required hardware at boot, initialization scripts and more.
						  It contains a bootable root file system with a running kernel and a systemd unit.
						  It is configured by using the /etc/dracut.conf.d/ directory, the dracut command.
						  To inspect initramfs file		--> dracut  ||	lsinitrd
	Step 5:
