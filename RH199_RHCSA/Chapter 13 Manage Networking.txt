Validate Network Configurations: -
-------------------------------
	1. Use ip command to view device and address information.
	2. link/ether string shows MAC address of the device.
	3. inet string shows IPv4 address, its prefix length and scope
	4. inet6 string shows IPv6 address, its prefix length, scope, link scope only used local ethernet link communication.
	5. IPv4 each place takes 1 byte of space and has 4 fields which is separated by period ( x.x.x.x ). Maximum value for each field is 225.
	6. IPv6 each place takes 2 bytes of space and has 8 fields which is separated by colon ( x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x ). Maximum value for each field is ffff.
	7. IPv4 class and range: -
		Class A (used by big network providers):				1.0.0.0 to 127.225.225.225
		Class B (used by big organizations):					128.0.0.0 to 191.225.225.225
		Class C (used by small organizations):					192.0.0.0 to 223.225.225.225
		Class D (used to defined multicast address):			224.0.0.0 to 239.225.225.225
		Class E (reserved for research and future purchase):	240.0.0.0 to 225.225.225.225
	8. IPv4 network id (NID) and host id (HID): -
		Class A:	1 NID + 3 HID
		Class B:	2 NID + 2 HID
		Class C:	3 NID + 1 HID
		Class D:	4 NID
		Class E:	4 NID

To list all available network interface on system					-> ip link show
To display information of specific network interface				-> ip link show [ network interface name ]
To display performance statistics of network interface				-> ip -s link show [ network interface name ]
To verify connection between hosts with specific count using IPv4	-> ping -c[ number of iteration ] [ host name with domain name or ip4 of host ]
To verify connection between hosts with specific count using IPv6	-> ping6 [ ip6 of host ]
To display routing information of IPv4								-> ip route
To display routing infomation of IPv6								-> ip -6 route
To trace network traffic to  reach remote host						-> tracepath [ host name ]
Login to another host through IPv4 and hostname						-> ssh x.x.x.x@[ host name ]
Login to another host through IPv6 and hostname						-> ssh x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x%[ host name ]
