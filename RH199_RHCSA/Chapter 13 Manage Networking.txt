Validate Network Configurations: -
-------------------------------
	1. Use ip command to view device and address information.
	2. link/ether string shows MAC address of the device.
	3. inet string shows IPv4 address, its prefix length and scope
	4. inet6 string shows IPv6 address, its prefix length, scope, link scope only used local ethernet link communication.
	5. IPv4 each place takes 1 byte of space and has 4 fields which is separated by period ( x.x.x.x ). Maximum value for each field is 225.
	6. IPv6 each place takes 2 bytes of space and has 8 fields which is separated by colon ( x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x ). Maximum value for each field is ffff.
	7. IPv4 class and range: -
		Class A (used by big network providers):				1.0.0.0 to 127.225.225.225
		Class B (used by big organizations):					128.0.0.0 to 191.225.225.225
		Class C (used by small organizations):					192.0.0.0 to 223.225.225.225
		Class D (used to defined multicast address):			224.0.0.0 to 239.225.225.225
		Class E (reserved for research and future purchase):	240.0.0.0 to 225.225.225.225
	8. IPv4 network id (NID) and host id (HID): -
		Class A:	1 NID + 3 HID
		Class B:	2 NID + 2 HID
		Class C:	3 NID + 1 HID
		Class D:	4 NID
		Class E:	4 NID
	9. Information related to well-known ports are listed on file	-> /etc/services
	10. To display socket statistics								-> ss [OPTIONS]
		[OPTIONS]		[DESCRIPTION]
			-n			show port and interface numbers instead of name
			-t			show TCP sockets
			-u			show UPD sockets
			-l			show listening sockets
			-a			show all sockets
			-p			show process used by sockets
			-A inet		show active connections but not listening sockets for inet address family
			-A inet6	show active connections but not listening sockets for inet6 address family

To list all available network interface on system					-> ip link show
To display information of specific network interface				-> ip link show [ network interface name ]
To display performance statistics of network interface				-> ip -s link show [ network interface name ]
To verify connection between hosts with specific count using IPv4	-> ping -c[ number of iteration ] [ host name or ip4 of host ]
To verify connection between hosts with specific count using IPv6	-> ping6 [ ip6 of host ]
To display routing information of IPv4								-> ip route
To display routing infomation of IPv6								-> ip -6 route
To trace network traffic to reach remote host						-> tracepath [ host name ]
To trace network traffic to reach remote host by IPv6				-> tracepath6 [ host name ]
Login to another host through IPv4 and hostname						-> ssh x.x.x.x@[ host name ]
Login to another host through IPv6 and hostname						-> ssh x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x%[ host name ]

Configure Networking from the Command Line: -
------------------------------------------
	1. Network configurations are stored in directory if any changes made by `nmcli con mod [ network interface name ]`		->	/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/
	2. Run `nmcli con reload` to inform NetworkManager about these changes.
	3. Sample of configuration file: -
		/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/[ Connection Name  ].nmconnection
		========================================================================
		[connection]
		id=[ connection name ]
		uuid=
		interface-name=[ network interface name ]
		mac-address=[ xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx ]
		type=[ type of connection ]
		autoconnect=[ true | false ]

		[ipv4]
		address1=[ x.x.x.x ]/24
		geteway=[ x.x.x.x ]
		dns=[ x.x.x.x ]
		dns-search=[ host name ].[ domain name ]
		method=[ manual | dhcp ]
		ignore-auto-dns=[ true | false ]

		[ipv6]
		address1=[ x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x ]/24
		gateway=[ x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x ]
		dns=[ x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x ]
		dns-search=[ host name ].[ domain name ]
		method=[ manual | auto | dhcp ]
		ignore-auto-dns=[ true | false ]

Configure Hostnames and Name Resolution: -
---------------------------------------
	1. Static host name are stored in /etc/hostnames file.
	2. Mapping of IP address to host or domain name are stored in /etc/hosts file.
	3. /etc/resolv.conf file controls how query is performed.


To display host name											-> hostname
