Mount and Unmount File System: -
-----------------------------
	1. For accessing file system, we have to mount that storage device.
	2. Mounting a storage device in file system can be done using mount command.
	3. mount command can use in 2 ways: -
		(a) with device file name i.e., file name stored in /dev directory.
		(b) with UUID (Universal Unique Identifier of the Device).
	   Also adding any mount point at end i.e., any user made directory.
	4. Before mount we must first create out own directory within /mnt ( used for temporary mount point).

To list details of all available block devices			-> lsblk
To list details of specified block device				-> lsblk /dev/[ storage name ]
To mount storage on file system							-> mount /dev/[ storage name ] /mnt/[ directory path name ]
